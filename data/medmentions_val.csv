"Impact of Chemotherapy on Diet and Nutritional Status of Women with Breast Cancer: A Prospective Study Certain food groups are often rejected during chemotherapy (CT) due to the side effects of treatment, which may interfere with adequate diet and nutritional status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment impact on the diet and nutritional status of women with breast cancer (BC). In this prospective longitudinal study, conducted in 2014-2015, 55 women diagnosed with BC, with a mean age 51.5Â±10.1 years, were followed and data were collected at three different times. Anthropometric and dietary assessments were performed, the latter by applying nine 24h dietary recall s, by using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index Revised (BHEI-R), and calculating the prevalence of inadequacy by the EAR cut-off point method. Regarding the BHEI-R analysis, the majority of women had a "" diet requires modification ', both at the beginning (T0, 58.2%, n = 32) and during treatment (T1, 54.5%, n = 30). However, after the end of the CT, the greater percentage of patients (T2, 49.1%, n = 27) were classified as having an "" inadequate diet "", since the Total Fruit consumption as well as the Dark Green and Orange Vegetable and Legume consumption decreased significantly during treatment (p = 0.043 and p = 0.026, respectively). There was a significant reduction in the intake of macro and micronutrients, with a high prevalence of inadequacy, of up to 100%, for calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin B6, vitamin C and zinc. Assessment of the nutritional status indicated that 56% (n = 31) of patients were overweight at these three different times. Weight, BMI and Waist Circumference increased significantly, indicating a worse nutritional status, and there was a correlation between poor diet quality and higher values for BMI, Waist-Hip Ratio and Waist-to-Height Ratio. Chemotherapy interferes in the patients ' diet generating a negative impact on the quality and intake of micro and macronutrients, as well as an impact on their nutritional status, with an increase in anthropometric measurements.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Sinogram -based coil selection for streak artifact reduction in undersampled radial real-time magnetic resonance imaging Streak artifacts are a common problem in radial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We therefore developed a method for automatically excluding receiver coil elements which lead to these artifacts. The proposed coil selection relates to real-time MRI data based on highly undersampled radial acquisitions. It exploits differences between high- and low-resolution sinograms reconstructed from datasets acquired during preparatory scans. Apart from phantom validations, the performance was assessed for real-time MRI studies of different human organ systems in vivo. The algorithm greatly reduces streak artifact strength without compromising image quality in other parts of the image. It is robust with respect to different experimental settings and fast to be included in the online reconstruction pipeline for real-time MRI. The proposed method enables a fast reduction of streak artifacts in radial real-time MRI.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Chronic exposure to haloperidol and olanzapine leads to common and divergent shape changes in the rat hippocampus in the absence of grey-matter volume loss One of the most consistently reported brain abnormalities in schizophrenia (SCZ) is decreased volume and shape deformation of the hippocampus. However, the potential contribution of chronic antipsychotic medication exposure to these phenomena remains unclear. We examined the effect of chronic exposure (8 weeks) to clinically relevant doses of either haloperidol (HAL) or olanzapine (OLZ) on adult rat hippocampal volume and shape using ex vivo structural MRI with the brain retained inside the cranium to prevent distortions due to dissection, followed by tensor-based morphometry (TBM) and elastic surface-based shape deformation analysis. The volume of the hippocampus was also measured post-mortem from brain tissue sections in each group. Chronic exposure to either HAL or OLZ had no effect on the volume of the hippocampus, even at exploratory thresholds, which was confirmed post-mortem. In contrast, shape deformation analysis revealed that chronic HAL and OLZ exposure lead to both common and divergent shape deformations (q = 0.05, FDR-corrected) in the rat hippocampus. In particular, in the dorsal hippocampus, HAL exposure led to inward shape deformation, whereas OLZ exposure led to outward shape deformation. Interestingly, outward shape deformations that were common to both drugs occurred in the ventral hippocampus. These effects remained significant after controlling for hippocampal volume suggesting true shape changes. Chronic exposure to either HAL or OLZ leads to both common and divergent effects on rat hippocampal shape in the absence of volume change. The implications of these findings for the clinic are discussed.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Novel protein - inhibitor interactions in site 3 of Ca(2+)-bound S100B as discovered by X-ray crystallography Structure-based drug discovery is under way to identify and develop small-molecule S100B inhibitors (SBiXs). Such inhibitors have therapeutic potential for treating malignant melanoma, since high levels of S100B downregulate wild-type p53 tumor suppressor function in this cancer. Computational and X-ray crystallographic studies of two S100B - SBiX complexes are described, and both compounds (apomorphine hydrochloride and ethidium bromide) occupy an area of the S100B hydrophobic cleft which is termed site 3. These data also reveal novel protein - inhibitor interactions which can be used in future drug-design studies to improve SBiX affinity and specificity. Of particular interest, apomorphine hydrochloride showed S100B -dependent killing in melanoma cell assays, although the efficacy exceeds its affinity for S100B and implicates possible off-target contributions. Because there are no structural data available for compounds occupying site 3 alone, these studies contribute towards the structure-based approach to targeting S100B by including interactions with residues in site 3 of S100B.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Antenatal consultation following limb malformation discovery using ultrasound scan Our unit has been providing antenatal consultations for 30 years following the discovery of limb malformation with the fetus. Each of these consultations is specific and carried out by a multi-professional team. It requires a physical and rehabilitation doctor, an orthopedic surgeon, an occupational therapist for upper limb malformation, a physiotherapist for lower malformation and a psychologist. This multidisciplinary consultation is unique because of each pregnancy story, because of each patient life story but also because of the words used by the sonologist when announcing the diagnosis. We deal with couples shocked by the prenatal diagnosis. We help them get acceptance of the child to be born and to forget about their imaginary child. Medical information is often perceived as being ""a surfeit of information "" difficult to handle by the couple stunned by the overwhelming diagnosis. We must stress that it is critical to not only have a good medical description of the malformations and potential treatments but also a good psychological support (parents personal life story, self-defense mechanism, guilt feeling). The ethical aspect of this consultation is also important. Team members must be as neutral as possible in their assessments in order to let the couple take the final decision: the continuation of the pregnancy or a request of voluntary termination of pregnancy. These prenatal consultations highlight the importance of the multidisciplinary global care.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A microbial signature for Crohn's disease A decade of microbiome studies has linked IBD to an alteration in the gut microbial community of genetically predisposed subjects. However, existing profiles of gut microbiome dysbiosis in adult IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies, and did not allow the identification of microbial signatures for CD and UC. Here, we aimed to compare the faecal microbiome of CD with patients having UC and with non - IBD subjects in a longitudinal study. We analysed a cohort of 2045 non - IBD and IBD faecal samples from four countries (Spain, Belgium, the UK and Germany), applied a 16S rRNA sequencing approach and analysed a total dataset of 115 million sequences. In the Spanish cohort, dysbiosis was found significantly greater in patients with CD than with UC, as shown by a more reduced diversity, a less stable microbial community and eight microbial groups were proposed as a specific microbial signature for CD. Tested against the whole cohort, the signature achieved an overall sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 94%, 94%, 89% and 91% for the detection of CD versus healthy controls, patients with anorexia, IBS and UC, respectively. Although UC and CD share many epidemiologic, immunologic, therapeutic and clinical features, our results showed that they are two distinct subtypes of IBD at the microbiome level. For the first time, we are proposing microbiomarkers to discriminate between CD and non - CD independently of geographical regions.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"An ancient role for nitric oxide in regulating the animal pelagobenthic life cycle: evidence from a marine sponge In many marine invertebrates, larval metamorphosis is induced by environmental cues that activate sensory receptors and signalling pathways. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous signalling molecule that regulates metamorphosis in diverse bilaterians. In most cases NO inhibits or represses this process, although it functions as an activator in some species. Here we demonstrate that NO positively regulates metamorphosis in the poriferan Amphimedon queenslandica. High rates of A. queenslandica metamorphosis normally induced by a coralline alga are inhibited by an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and by a NO scavenger. Consistent with this, an artificial donor of NO induces metamorphosis even in the absence of the alga. Inhibition of the ERK signalling pathway prevents metamorphosis in concert with, or downstream of, NO signalling; a NO donor cannot override the ERK inhibitor. NOS gene expression is activated late in embryogenesis and in larvae, and is enriched in specific epithelial and subepithelial cell types, including a putative sensory cell, the globular cell; DAF-FM staining supports these cells being primary sources of NO. Together, these results are consistent with NO playing an activating role in induction of A. queenslandica metamorphosis, evidence of its highly conserved regulatory role in metamorphosis throughout the Metazoa.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Aspirin Suppresses Growth in PI3K - Mutant Breast Cancer by Activating AMPK and Inhibiting mTORC1 Signaling Despite the high incidence of oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K, PI3K inhibitors have yielded little clinical benefit for breast cancer patients. Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested a therapeutic benefit from aspirin intake in cancers harboring oncogenic PIK3CA Here, we show that mutant PIK3CA - expressing breast cancer cells have greater sensitivity to aspirin -mediated growth suppression than their wild-type counterparts. Aspirin decreased viability and anchorage-independent growth of mutant PIK3CA breast cancer cells independently of its effects on COX-2 and NF-ÎºB. We ascribed the effects of aspirin to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, mTORC1 inhibition, and autophagy induction. In vivo, oncogenic PIK3CA -driven mouse mammary tumors treated daily with aspirin resulted in decreased tumor growth kinetics, whereas combination therapy of aspirin and a PI3K inhibitor further attenuated tumor growth. Our study supports the evaluation of aspirin and PI3K pathway inhibitors as a combination therapy for targeting breast cancer. Cancer Res; 77(3); 790-801.

"Noteworthy Literature Published in 2016 for Thoracic Surgery The past year has produced several important articles in the field of thoracic surgery, spanning many different diseases. Thoracic surgeons continue to investigate methods to perform complex operations and procedures less invasively, with the least possible morbidity to our patients. We also continue to critically evaluate new technology and procedures to ensure that they meet our rigorous standards for oncologic efficacy and for management of benign disease. Importantly, as we continue to evolve, thoracic surgeons have remained focused on optimizing processes of care, both inside and outside the operating room.

"A Malaria Transmission Model with Temperature -Dependent Incubation Period Malaria is an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites and is transmitted among humans by female Anopheles mosquitoes. Climate factors have significant impact on both mosquito life cycle and parasite development. To consider the temperature sensitivity of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of malaria parasites, we formulate a delay differential equations model with a periodic time delay. We derive the basic reproduction ratio [Formula: see text] and establish a threshold type result on the global dynamics in terms of [Formula: see text], that is, the unique disease-free periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text]; and the model system admits a unique positive periodic solution which is globally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text]. Numerically, we parameterize the model with data from Maputo Province, Mozambique, and simulate the long-term behavior of solutions. The simulation result is consistent with the obtained analytic result. In addition, we find that using the time -averaged EIP may underestimate the basic reproduction ratio.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Propulsion strategy in the gait of primary school children; the effect of age and speed The strategy used to generate power for forward propulsion in walking and running has recently been highlighted as a marker of gait maturation and elastic energy recycling. This study investigated ankle and hip power generation as a propulsion strategy (PS) during the late stance / early swing phases of walking and running in typically developing (TD) children (15: six to nine years; 17: nine to 13 years) using three-dimensional gait analysis. Peak ankle power generation at push-off (peakA2), peak hip power generation in early swing (peakH3) and propulsion strategy (PS) [peakA2 / (peakA2+peakH3)] were calculated to provide the relative contribution of ankle power to total propulsion. Mean PS values decreased as speed increased for comfortable walking (p<0.001), fast walking (p<0.001) and fast running (p<0.001), and less consistently during jogging (p=0.054). PS varied with age (p<0.001) only during fast walking. At any speed of fast walking, older children generated more peakA2 (p=0.001) and less peakH3 (p=0.001) than younger children. While the kinetics of running propulsion appear to be developed by age six years, the skills of fast walking appeared to require additional neuromuscular maturity. These findings support the concept that running is a skill that matures early for TD children.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Unusual Salt and pH Induced Changes in Polyethylenimine Solutions Linear PEI is a cationic polymer commonly used for complexing DNA into nanoparticles for cell-transfection and gene-therapy applications. The polymer has closely-spaced amines with weak-base protonation capacity, and a hydrophobic backbone that is kept unaggregated by intra-chain repulsion. As a result, in solution PEI exhibits multiple buffering mechanisms, and polyelectrolyte states that shift between aggregated and free forms. We studied the interplay between the aggregation and protonation behavior of 2.5 kDa linear PEI by pH probing, vapor pressure osmometry, dynamic light scattering, and ninhydrin assay. Our results indicate that: At neutral pH, the PEI chains are associated and the addition of NaCl initially reduces and then increases the extent of association .The aggregate form is uncollapsed and co-exists with the free chains. PEI buffering occurs due to continuous or discontinuous charging between stalled states. Ninhydrin assay tracks the number of unprotonated amines in PEI .The size of PEI - DNA complexes is not significantly affected by the free vs. aggregated state of the PEI polymer. Despite its simple chemical structure, linear PEI displays intricate solution dynamics, which can be harnessed for environment - sensitive biomaterials and for overcoming current challenges with DNA delivery.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Opportunistic screening for osteoporosis by routine CT in Southern Europe Feasibility evaluation of early detection of osteoporosis in oncologic patients by bone mineral density (BMD) on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans performed for other clinical indications, by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference. Abdominal CT images can identify patients with osteoporosis BMD without additional radiation exposure or cost. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of early detection of osteoporosis by bone mineral density (BMD) on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans performed in oncologic patients, comparing calibrated and uncalibrated measurements by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference. We also performed an external validation of a threshold of 160 Hounsfield units (HU), proposed as highly sensitive. Cohort comprised CT - DXA pairs within a 6-month period performed for any indication on 326 consecutive adults, aged 62.4 Â± 12.38 years (mean Â± standard deviation). CT attenuation of trabecular bone in HU was measured at the axial cross sections of L1, L2, L3, and L4 vertebrae. Vertebral compression fractures were assessed by sagittal reconstruction view. Diagnostic performance measures and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) for diagnosing osteoporosis were calculated. BMD values were statistical significantly lower at any vertebral level from L1 to L4 for patients with osteoporosis defined by DXA (p < 0.001). Calibrated and uncalibrated BMD values were significantly correlated (R (2) = 0.833, p < 0.01). An uncalibrated L1 CT attenuation threshold of 160 HU was more than 90 % sensitive, and a threshold of 73 HU was more than 90 % specific for distinguishing osteoporosis BMD. Fifty-nine percent of patients with vertebral compression fracture had non - osteoporotic DXA T-scores. Abdominal CT images obtained for other reasons can identify patients with osteoporosis BMD without additional radiation exposure or cost. Uncalibrated values at L1 can detect more osteoporosis patients with spinal compression fractures than DXA in oncologic patients.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"TBL1XR1 predicts isolated tumor cells and micrometastasis in patients with TNM stage I/II colorectal cancer A considerable number of early stage colorectal cancer (CRC) patients may develop cancer relapse or metastasis after curative surgery. Isolated tumor cells (ITC) and micrometastasis in lymph nodes (LNMM), which are undetectable by conventional pathological examination, may be one primary reason. Detection of ITC / LNMM is time-consuming and cost-ineffective, we aimed to find biomarkers in primary CRC tissues to help predicting ITC / LNMM status. We enrolled 137 node-negative patients with early stage CRC in this study. Existence of ITC / LNMM was identified by immunohistological staining with cytokeratin 20 in resected lymph nodes. Expression of transducin (Î²)-like 1 X-linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) in primary CRC tissues was also investigated. Chi-square test was performed to reveal the correlations between ITC / LNMM and clinicopathological characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine independent prognostic factors. Knock-down experiment together with proliferation and invasion assays were carried out to explore molecular mechanisms between TBL1XR1 and ITC / LNMM. 29.2% (40/137) patients were identified as ITC / LNMM positive and most of them (32/40 cases, 80%) showed high TBL1XR1 expression in primary CRC tissues. Both ITC / LNMM and TBL1XR1 expression were independent prognostic factors for disease relapse or metastasis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TBL1XR1 can regulate the expression of VEGF-C and epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins, thus mediate the process of lymph node metastasis. Identification of ITC / LNMM is significant in evaluating clinical outcome and guiding adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage CRC patients. TBL1XR1 overexpression in CRC tissues can serve as an efficient biomarker to predict the status of ITC / LNMM.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"An influenza A virus (H7N9) anti-neuraminidase monoclonal antibody with prophylactic and therapeutic activity in vivo Zoonotic A(H7N9) avian influenza viruses emerged in China in 2013 and continue to be a threat to human public health, having infected over 800 individuals with a mortality rate approaching 40%. Treatment options for people infected with A(H7N9) include the use of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors. However, like other influenza viruses, A(H7N9) can become resistant to these drugs. The use of monoclonal antibodies is a rapidly developing strategy for controlling influenza virus infection. Here we generated a murine monoclonal antibody (3c10-3) directed against the NA of A(H7N9) and show that prophylactic systemic administration of 3c10-3 fully protected mice from lethal challenge with wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9). Further, post- infection treatment with a single systemic dose of 3c10-3 at either 24, 48 or 72 h post A(H7N9) challenge resulted in both dose - and time - dependent protection of up to 100% of mice, demonstrating therapeutic potential for 3c10-3. Epitope mapping revealed that 3c10-3 binds near the enzyme active site of NA, and functional characterization showed that 3c10-3 inhibits the enzyme activity of NA and restricts the cell -to- cell spread of the virus in cultured cells. Affinity analysis also revealed that 3c10-3 binds equally well to recombinant NA of wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 and to a variant NA carrying a R289K mutation known to infer NAI resistance. These results suggest that 3c10-3 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic to treat A(H7N9) infections either as an alternative to, or in combination with, current NA antiviral inhibitors.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Idiopathic Trigeminal Neuralgia; does the status of offending vessels influence on pain control or side effects? To determine pain control and side effects after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for classical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with or without neurovascular compression (NVC). This study included 47 patients with type 1 idiopathic TN and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain class IV or V that were treated with GKRS, with maximal dose of 85 Gy targeting root entry zone, as a first-treatment modality between January 2005 and March 2015. A retrospective analysis was made of NVC status, pain control, side effects, recurrence, and cross-sectional area. During the median 21.5 months follow-up (range, 3-119 months), 36 (76.6%) patients showed good outcomes (improved to below BNI class IIIa). Twenty two patients did not show NVC (group A) and 25 had NVC present (group B). Good outcomes were not different in two groups (group A: 19/22; group B: 17/25)(p = 0.138). The numbers of cases in BNI class I or II, and recurrences were not different (p = 0.532, 0.786, respectively). The mean areas were 8.64 Â± 2.59 mm3 in non-deviated cases (n = 27) and 2.59 Â± 1.68 mm3 in deviated (n = 10). Side effects were significantly more frequent in deviated cases (8/10; 80%) than in non-deviated (7/27; 25.9%) (p = 0.003). NVC is not a predictive factor for pain control after GKRS for the treatment of idiopathic TN. Side effects may occur more frequently in patients with NVC at the target coordinate when a root entry zone is used, but the subjective symptoms are not always bothersome.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Estimating body size in early primates: The case of Archicebus and Teilhardina Obtaining accurate estimations of the body mass of fossil primates has always been a subject of interest in paleoanthropology because mass is an important determinant for so many other aspects of biology, ecology, and life history. This paper focuses on the issues involved in attempting to reconstruct the mass of two early Eocene haplorhine primates, Teilhardina and Archicebus, which pose particular problems due to their small size and temporal and phylogenetic distance from extant primates. In addition to a ranking of variables from more to less useful, the effect of using models of varying taxonomic and size compositions is examined. Phylogenetic correction is also applied to the primate database. Our results indicate that the choice of variable is more critical than the choice of model. The more reliable variables are the mediolateral breadth across the femoral condyles and the area of the calcaneocuboid facet of the calcaneus. These variables suggest a body mass of 39 g (range 33-46 g) for Archicebus and 48 g (range 44-56 g) for Teilhardina. The width of the distal femur is found to be the most consistent estimator across models of various composition and techniques. The effect of phylogenetic correction is small but the choice of branch length assumption affects point estimates for the fossils. The majority of variables and models predict the body mass of Archicebus and Teilhardina to be in the range of the smaller extant mouse lemurs, as expected.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The Modified 3-square Flap Method for Reconstruction of Toe Syndactyly Bandoh reported the 3-square-flap method as a procedure for interdigital space reconstruction in patients with minor syndactyly. We recently modified this flap design so that it could be used in the treatment of toe syndactyly involving fusion of the areas distal to the proximal interphalangeal joint. With our method, the reconstructed interdigital space consists of 4 oblong flaps (A through D). Flaps A and D are designed on the dorsal side, flap B is designed on the frontal plane of the interdigital space, and flap C is designed on the plantar side. Flaps A, B, and C are raised immediately below the dermis in a manner that allowed slight fat tissue to adhere to each flap. Flap D is freed to a degree minimally needed for dislocation, while leaving a thick subcutaneous pedicle. Flaps A, B, and C are each folded in 90 degrees; flap D is dislocated to the proximal plane of the reconstructed digit, followed by skin suturing. In this process, suturing is avoided between flaps A and C, between flaps A and D, and between flaps B and D. During the period of 2011 to 2015, we treated 8 patients of toe syndactyly involving fusion distal to the proximal interphalangeal joint. Cases of congenital syndactyly received surgery between the ages of 8 and 11 months. Using this technique, flap ischemia / necrosis was not observed. During the postoperative follow-up period, the interdigital space retained sufficient depth without developing any scar contracture. No case required additional surgery.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Stress and Intimate Partner Aggression Evidence suggests that stressed couples also tend to be aggressive couples. Chronic external stresses interact with individuals' dispositional and regulatory deficiencies, resulting in a spillover of these stresses into the relationship. High individual stress in combination with problematic interaction styles and problem-solving abilities increases the likelihood of IPA. We applied the I(3) Model to better organize the instigating, impelling, and inhibiting factors and processes that moderate the stress - IPA association. Evidence suggests that certain forms of stress, such as IPA victimization, reliably instigate IPA perpetration, with weak inhibitory processes and impaired problem solving moderating the stress - IPA association. More research is needed that specifies the 'perfect storm' of factors that increase our understanding of how, and for whom, stress increases IPA risk.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Technical Note: Bone mineral density measurements of strontium -rich trabecular bone - mimicking phantoms using quantitative ultrasound Bone quantity, as determined by the current gold standard, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), through measured areal bone mineral density (aBMD), is subject to positive biases if bone strontium levels are high. This is of particular concern for populations administered strontium-based compounds for the treatment of osteoporosis. This study investigated the dependence of bone mineral density (BMD) determinations, and associated ultrasound -determined indices, obtained by quantitative ultrasound (QUS), on bone strontium content using a new generation of trabecular bone - mimicking phantoms. A new generation of bone - mimicking phantoms, consisting of hydroxyapatite (HA) and gelatin, was developed. Castor oil layers were included in these phantoms to create a multilayer bone - mimicking phantom. These phantoms were prepared using a bone mineral fraction consisting of varying strontium concentrations in the range of 0-2.5% mol/mol as strontium-substituted HA. The effect of varying bone strontium content on determined quality indices was evaluated based on determined speed of sound (SOS), broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and determined quantitative ultrasound index (QUI) for phantoms with varying BMD values and varying strontium concentration using two QUS systems: a clinical SaharaÂ® system and an in-house research system with two identical transducers with center frequency of 1 MHz. The two QUS systems were also compared through a Bland-Altman analysis. Both the clinical system and the research QUS systems showed a strong dependency between BMD and BUA, indicating a potential for QUS to be used as a means of estimating BMD (p = 0.001). SOS was found to have no correlation to BMD (p = 0.546). There was no correlation observed between BUA and increasing bone strontium concentrations for the research (p = 0.749) and clinical (p = 0.609) QUS systems. Similarly, no dependency was observed between the SOS and bone strontium levels up to 2.5 mol/mol [Sr /(Sr + Ca)]% for the research (p = 0.862) and clinical (p = 0.481) QUS systems. No effect on the QUI values was observed with changing strontium levels with either research (p = 0.939) or clinical QUS systems (p = 0.931). A Bland-Altman analysis showed that there was a clear offset in determined QUI values for both systems but they are in agreement with one another. Bone quality can be assessed through the use of QUS while increasing bone strontium concentration was found to have no effect on QUS -determined quality indices. This study concludes that QUS can potentially be used for the determination of bone quality without introducing biases due to bone strontium levels as is known to be the case with DXA determined aBMD.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Identification of Chlamydia trachomatis Antigens Recognized by T Cells From Highly Exposed Women Who Limit or Resist Genital Tract Infection Natural infection induces partial immunity to Chlamydia trachomatis Identification of chlamydial antigens that induce interferon Î³ (IFN-) secretion by T cells from immune women could advance vaccine development. IFN-Î³ production by CD4(+) and CD8(+) peripheral blood T cells from 58 high-risk women was measured after coculture with antigen-presenting cells preincubated with recombinant Escherichia coli expressing a panel of 275 chlamydial antigens. Quantile median regression analysis was used to compare frequencies of IFN-Î³ responses in women with only cervical infection to those in women with endometrial infection and frequencies in women who remained uninfected for over 1 year to those in women who developed incident infection. Statistical methods were then used to identify proteins associated with protection. A higher median frequency of CD8(+) T-cell responses was detected in women with lower genital tract chlamydial infection, compared with those with upper genital tract chlamydial infection (13.8% vs 9.5%; P =04), but the CD4(+) T-cell response frequencies were not different. Women who remained uninfected displayed a greater frequency of positive CD4(+) T-cell responses (29% vs 18%; P < .0001), compared with women who had incident infection, while the frequencies of CD8(+) T-cell responses did not differ. A subset of proteins involved in central metabolism, type III secretion, and protein synthesis were associated with protection. Investigations in naturally exposed women reveal protective responses and identify chlamydial vaccine candidate antigens.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The Effect of Oxygen Inhalation Plus Oxytocin Compared with Oxytocin Only on Postpartum Haemorrhage: A Randomized Clinical Trial Post Partum Haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality across the world, mainly in the developing countries. The present study was conducted with the aim to investigate effect of oxygen inhalation plus oxytocin compared with oxytocin only on PPH. This study was a clinical trial which was performed in Shahid Mustafa Khomieni Teaching Hospital of Ilam (western Iran) from April 2012 to Nov 2013. One hundred and twenty pregnant women who were referred to delivery ward for normal vaginal delivery were selected with convenience sampling method and they were randomly assigned into two groups. For both groups management of the third stage of labour was done using 1000CC Ringer and 20 units of Oxytocin. In the intervention group, in addition to the routine administration, 8 liters of oxygen via face mask was used continuously until 2 hours after delivery. Blood loss was determined by regular weighing of the buttocks that were previously weighted. The difference was calculated before and after weighing (1 gram increasing of weight was considered to be equivalent to 1CC blood loss). Data were analysed by SPSS 16 version using Student- t and Chi-square tests. The two groups were homogenous in regard to all the base line variables. The study results indicated that the mean of blood loss were (256.16Â±97) ml at two hours after delivery in the control group and (149.5Â±46.49) ml in the intervention group. There was a significant difference between PPH of the two groups (p<0.006). Research findings showed that the use of inspired oxygen during the third stage of labour and oxytocin infusion during 2hours later resulted in a significant decreasing in the amount of bleeding after normal vaginal delivery.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Characterization of Phytochrome Interacting Factors from the Moss Physcomitrella patens Illustrates Conservation of Phytochrome Signaling Modules in Land Plants Across the plant kingdom, phytochrome (PHY) photoreceptors play an important role during adaptive and developmental responses to light. In Arabidopsis thaliana, light-activated PHYs accumulate in the nucleus, where they regulate downstream signaling components, such as phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs). PIFs are transcription factors that act as repressors of photomorphogenesis; their inhibition by PHYs leads to substantial changes in gene expression. The nuclear function of PHYs, however, has so far been investigated in only a few non-seed plants. Here, we identified putative target genes of PHY signaling in the moss Physcomitrella patens and found light-regulated genes that are putative orthologs of PIF-controlled genes in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that an ancestral PIF-like gene was already present in streptophyte algae, i.e., before the water-to-land transition of plants. The PIF homologs in the genome of P. patens resemble Arabidopsis PIFs in their protein domain structure, molecular properties, and physiological effects, albeit with notable differences in the motif-dependent PHY interaction. Our results suggest that P. patens PIFs are involved in PHY signaling. The PHY-PIF signaling node that relays light signals to target genes has been largely conserved during land plant evolution, with evidence of lineage-specific diversification.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Association of Radiomics and Metabolic Tumor Volumes in Radiation Treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme To build a framework for investigation of the associations between imaging, clinical target volumes (CTVs), and metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) features for better understanding of the underlying information in the CTVs and dependencies between these volumes. High-throughput extraction of imaging and metabolomic quantitative features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) results in tens of variables per patient. In radiation therapy of GBM the relevant metabolic tumor volumes (MTVs) are related to aberrant levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and choline (Cho). The corresponding clinical target volumes (CTVs) for radiation therapy are based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w)/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI. Necrotic portions, enhancing lesion, and edema were manually contoured on CE-T1w / T2w images for 17 GBM patients. Clinical target volumes and MTVs for NAA (MTVNAA) and Cho (MTVCho) were constructed. Imaging and metabolic features related to size, shape, and signal intensities of the volumes were extracted. Tumors were also scored categorically for 10 semantic imaging traits by a neuroradiologist. All features were investigated for redundancy. Two-way correlations between imaging and CTVs / MTVs features were visualized as heatmaps. Associations between MTVNAA and MTVCho and imaging features were studied using Spearman correlation. Forty-eight imaging features were extracted per patient. Half of the imaging traits were replaced with automatically extracted continuous variables. Twenty features were extracted from CTVs and MTVs. A series of semantic imaging traits were replaced with automatically extracted continuous variables. There were multiple (22) significant correlations of imaging measures with CTVs / MTVNAA, whereas there were only 6 with CTVs / MTVCho. A framework for investigation of codependencies between MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging radiomic features and CTVs / MTVs has been established. The MTV for NAA was found to be closely associated with MRI volumes, whereas very few imaging features were related to MTVCho, indicating that Cho provides additional information to imaging.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Support Vector Machine Classification of Drunk Driving Behaviour Alcohol is the root cause of numerous traffic accidents due to its pharmacological action on the human central nervous system. This study conducted a detection process to distinguish drunk driving from normal driving under simulated driving conditions. The classification was performed by a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained to distinguish between these two classes by integrating both driving performance and physiological measurements. In addition, principal component analysis was conducted to rank the weights of the features. The standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDNN), the root mean square value of the difference of the adjacent R-R interval series (RMSSD), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), the ratio of the low and high frequencies (LF/HF), and average blink duration were the highest weighted features in the study. The results show that SVM classification can successfully distinguish drunk driving from normal driving with an accuracy of 70%. The driving performance data and the physiological measurements reported by this paper combined with air - alcohol concentration could be integrated using the support vector regression classification method to establish a better early warning model, thereby improving vehicle safety.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 Gene-1562C>T Gene Polymorphism and Coronary Artery Disease in the Chinese Han Population: A Meta-Analysis of 5468 Subjects Multiple studies indicate that the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)-1562C>T gene polymorphism may be associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Chinese Han population. However, a clear consensus has yet to be established. A meta-analysis of 5468 subjects from 10 separate studies was performed to explore the possible relationship between the MMP-9-1562C>T gene polymorphism and CAD within the Chinese Han population. Pooled odds ratio (ORs) for the association and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated by a random or fixed-effect model. Our analysis confirms the association between the MMP-9-1562C>T gene polymorphism and an increased risk of CAD within the Chinese Han population under allelic (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.25-2.04, P = 0.0002), recessive (OR: 3.05, 95% CI: 1.67-5.56, P = 0.0003), dominant (OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.49-3.35, P = 0.0001), homozygous (OR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.87-6.23, P < 0.0001), heterozygous (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.40-2.93, P = 0.0002), and additive genetic models (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.33-2.39, P < 0.0001).

"Longitudinal live imaging of retinal Î±-synuclein :: GFP deposits in a transgenic mouse model of Parkinson's Disease / Dementia with Lewy Bodies Abnormal Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) accumulation in the CNS may underlie neuronal cell and synaptic dysfunction leading to motor and cognitive deficits in synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Multiple groups demonstrated Î±-syn accumulation in CNS accessory structures, including the eyes and olfactory terminals, as well as in peripheral organs of Parkinsonian patients. Retinal imaging studies of mice overexpressing fused Î±-syn :: GFP were conducted to evaluate the presence and progression of retinal pathology in a PD / DLB transgenic mouse model. Bright-field image retinal maps and fluorescent images were acquired at 1-month intervals for 3 months. Retinal imaging revealed the accumulation of GFP -tagged Î±-syn in retinal ganglion cell layer and in the edges of arterial blood vessels in the transgenic mice. Double labeling studies confirmed that the Î±-syn :: GFP -positive cells were retinal ganglion cells containing Î±-syn. Accumulation of Î±-syn persisted in the same cells and increased with age.

"Entrapment of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and its inferior cluneal branches: anatomical basis of surgery for inferior cluneal neuralgia The apparent failure of pudendal nerve surgery in some patients has led us to suggest the possibility of entrapment of other adjacent nerve structures, leading to the concept of inferior cluneal neuralgia. Via its numerous collateral branches, the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve innervates a very extensive territory including the posterior surface of the thigh, the infragluteal fold, the skin over the ischial tuberosity, but also the lateral anal region, scrotum or labium majus via its perineal branch. We described the pathophysiological features of cluneal neuralgia, the surgical technique and our preliminary results. We performed a transmuscular approach leading to the fat of the deep gluteal region. Exploration was continued cranially underneath the piriformis, looking for potential entrapments affecting the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and the sciatic nerve. Nerve decompression on the lateral surface of the ischial tuberosity was then performed. A constant anatomical finding must be highlighted: the presence of a lateral fibrous expansion from the ischium passing behind the nerves and vessels, especially the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and its perineal branches. In our patients, release of this expansion allowed decompression of the nerve trapped by this expansion. Cluneal neuralgia constitutes a distinct entity of perineal pain, which must be identified and distinguished from pudendal neuralgia. Surgery should be performed via a transgluteal approach. A lateral ischial obstacle must be investigated, in the form of a constant fibrous expansion, which, like a retinaculum, can cause nerve entrapment.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A new patient safety smartphone application for prevention of "" forgotten "" ureteral stents: results from a clinical pilot study in 194 patients Approximately 12% of all ureteral stents placed are retained or "" forgotten ."" Forgotten stents are associated with significant safety concerns as well as increased costs and legal issues. Retained ureteral stents (RUS) often occur due to lack of clinical follow-up, communication or language barriers, and economic concerns. We describe a multiplatform application that facilitates data collection to prevent RUS. The ""Stent Tracker"" application can be installed on mobile devices and computers. The encrypted and password-protected information is accessible from any device and provides information about each procedure, stent placement and removal dates, as well as product description. This multicenter retrospective study included 194 patients who underwent stent placement between July and October 2015. Nominal data was tallied and ordinal data was divided into quartiles of 25, 50, and 75%. A total of 194 patients from three institutions underwent ureteral stent placement. Reasons for stent placement include 122 cases post ureteroscopy (63%), 8 cases post percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) (4%), 14 cases post extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) (7%), 18 cases of cancer-related ureteral obstruction (9%), 21 cases of hydronephrosis (11%), and 11 for other reasons (6%). Of these patients, only one patient was lost to follow-up (0.5%). On average, ureteral stents were removed within 14 days of placement (IQR: 8-26 days). The "" Stent Tracker "" is a patient safety application that provides a secure and simplified interface, which can significantly reduce the incidence of RUS. Further developments could include automated notifications to patients and staff, color-coding, and integrated information with electronic patient charts.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Human mobility networks and persistence of rapidly mutating pathogens Rapidly mutating pathogens may be able to persist in the population and reach an endemic equilibrium by escaping hosts ' acquired immunity. For such diseases, multiple biological, environmental and population - level mechanisms determine the dynamics of the outbreak, including pathogen's epidemiological traits (e.g. transmissibility, infectious period and duration of immunity), seasonality, interaction with other circulating strains and hosts ' mixing and spatial fragmentation. Here, we study a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model on a metapopulation where individuals are distributed in sub-populations connected via a network of mobility flows. Through extensive numerical simulations, we explore the phase space of pathogen's persistence and map the dynamical regimes of the pathogen following emergence. Our results show that spatial fragmentation and mobility play a key role in the persistence of the disease whose maximum is reached at intermediate mobility values. We describe the occurrence of different phenomena including local extinction and emergence of epidemic waves, and assess the conditions for large-scale spreading. Findings are highlighted in reference to previous studies and to real scenarios. Our work uncovers the crucial role of hosts ' mobility on the ecological dynamics of rapidly mutating pathogens, opening the path for further studies on disease ecology in the presence of a complex and heterogeneous environment.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Expanding biological activities of Ts19 Frag-II toxin: Insights into IL-17 production Tityus serrulatus (Ts) venom is composed of a mixture of toxins presenting diverse biological functions. However, although this venom has been studied over the past three decades, omics analysis revealed that most of its toxins are not identified or their biological activities are unknown. Ts19 Frag-II is included is this group, which function is still uncertain. This study aimed to expand the biological activities of Ts19 Frag-II through in vivo investigation. Our results demonstrates that mice challenged with Ts19 Frag-II presented biochemical alterations, increasing serum levels of urea, ALT and Î²-globulin, besides decreasing Î³-globulins. Moreover, this toxin was also able to induce immunological alterations, increasing NO, IL-6, TNF-Î± and IL-17, being considered a proinflammatory toxin. The increase of IL-17 was unprecedented regarding Ts toxins and could be a result of the overall produced-effect of cells of innate immunity (neutrophils, monocytes, natural killers and lymphoid tissue inducers - LTis) cells) as well as of adaptive immunity (Th17 cells). This study expanded the biological activities of Ts19 Frag-II, suggesting that this toxin could be contributing to the Ts envenoming through alterations of biochemical parameters as well as triggering the inflammatory response.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The association between HIV, antiretroviral therapy, and gestational diabetes mellitus The widespread, chronic use of antiretroviral therapy raises questions concerning the metabolic consequences of HIV infection and treatment. Antiretroviral therapy, and specifically protease inhibitors, has been associated with hyperglycemia. As pregnant women are vulnerable to development of hyperglycemia, the objective of this study was to explore existing literature on the relationship between HIV infection, HIV treatment, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A systematic search was conducted in six databases for articles providing data on HIV-positivity, protease inhibitor exposure, and GDM or glucose intolerance development in pregnancy. The quality of articles was evaluated using an adapted Cochrane Collaboration bias assessment tool. Risk ratios were generated from pooled data using meta-analysis by the Mantel-Haenszel method. Of 891 references screened, six studies on the role of HIV-positivity, 10 on protease inhibitor use, and two on both were included. Meta-analysis showed no significant relationship between HIV infection and the development of GDM [risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47-1.37, I = 0%]. Meta-analysis of protease inhibitor exposure showed increased GDM in studies using first-generation protease inhibitors (risk ratio 2.29, 95% CI: 1.46-3.58) and studies using the strictest diagnosis criteria, the National Diabetes Data Group criteria for 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (risk ratio 3.81, 95% CI: 2.18-6.67). Meta-analysis showed no significant association between HIV-positivity and GDM. Significance of protease inhibitor use was limited to studies using the strictest diagnostic criteria for GDM. Results are limited by high risk of bias. Well designed prospective studies are needed to further clarify this relationship and its consequences for clinical practice.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Hemorrhage Risk of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations During Pregnancy and Puerperium in a North American Cohort Conclusions reached in existing literature about risk of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) hemorrhage during pregnancy are controversial. This study compares the risk of hemorrhage in pregnant and nonpregnant female patients with AVM in a North American cohort. We retrospectively reviewed female patients with AVM evaluated from 1990 to 2015. Exposure period for pregnancy and puerperium was calculated as 40 and 6 weeks, respectively, for each full-term pregnancy and 6 weeks for each abortion. Hemorrhage events and patient-years were calculated during an exposure period (pregnancy and puerperium), and a nonexposure period defined as either the interval from birth until AVM obliteration or until last follow-up after subtracting exposure period. Poisson rate ratio test was used to compare rate of hemorrhage between exposure and nonexposure periods. For 270 female patients with AVM, mean age was 35.0Â±19.6 years, and race distribution was white (n=165, 61.1%), black (n=59, 21.9%), Hispanic (n=9, 3.3%), Asian (n=6, 2.2%), and other (n=31, 11.5%). From 191 total pregnancies occurring before AVM obliteration, there were 175 (91.6%) term deliveries and 16 (8.4%) abortions. Overall annual hemorrhage rate for 149 total hemorrhages during an average of 11 097 patient-years was 1.34%. There were 140 hemorrhages in nonexposed women and 9 hemorrhages in pregnant women, translating to an annual hemorrhage rate of 1.3% in nonpregnant women versus 5.7% in pregnant women (P<0.001). Identical analysis for reproductive age patients (15-50) demonstrated a rate of 1.3% versus 7.0% (P<0.001). Our results conflict with those from a recent study describing no increased rate of rupture during pregnancy. This difference may reflect unique population attributes influencing brain AVM hemorrhage during pregnancy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Evaluation of Choroidal Thickness in Patients with Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome and Pseudoexfoliation Glaucoma Purpose. To compare the macular and peripapillary choroidal thickness in eyes with pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome and PEX glaucoma with the normal eyes of healthy controls. Materials and Methods. In this prospective study, 30 eyes of 30 patients with PEX syndrome, 28 eyes of 28 patients with PEX glaucoma, and 30 eyes of 30 age -matched healthy subjects were enrolled. Choroidal thicknesses in the macular and peripapillary areas were measured by using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Results. Gender, age, and axial length did not significantly differ between the groups (all, p > 0.05). The mean values of choroidal thickness in the macular and peripapillary areas (except the superior quadrant) in the patients with PEX syndrome and PEX glaucoma were lower compared with controls (all p < 0.05). The mean values of the macular and peripapillary choroidal thickness in the PEX glaucoma group were lower compared with PEX syndrome group; however this difference was not significant. Conclusions. The findings of this study revealed that macular and peripapillary choroidal thicknesses were decreased in PEX syndrome and PEX glaucoma cases. The role of choroid in the development of glaucomatous damage in patients with PEX syndrome remains unclear.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"About the Sterilization of Chitosan Hydrogel Nanoparticles In the last years, nanostructured biomaterials have raised a great interest as platforms for delivery of drugs, genes, imaging agents and for tissue engineering applications. In particular, hydrogel nanoparticles (HNP) associate the distinctive features of hydrogels (high water uptake capacity, biocompatibility) with the advantages of being possible to tailor its physicochemical properties at nano-scale to increase solubility, immunocompatibility and cellular uptake. In order to be safe, HNP for biomedical applications, such as injectable or ophthalmic formulations, must be sterile. Literature is very scarce with respect to sterilization effects on nanostructured systems, and even more in what concerns HNP. This work aims to evaluate the effect and effectiveness of different sterilization methods on chitosan (CS) hydrogel nanoparticles. In addition to conventional methods (steam autoclave and gamma irradiation), a recent ozone-based method of sterilization was also tested. A model chitosan - tripolyphosphate (TPP) hydrogel nanoparticles (CS - HNP), with a broad spectrum of possible applications was produced and sterilized in the absence and in the presence of protective sugars (glucose and mannitol). Properties like size, zeta potential, absorbance, morphology, chemical structure and cytotoxicity were evaluated. It was found that the CS - HNP degrade by autoclaving and that sugars have no protective effect. Concerning gamma irradiation, the formation of agglomerates was observed, compromising the suspension stability. However, the nanoparticles resistance increases considerably in the presence of the sugars. Ozone sterilization did not lead to significant physical adverse effects, however, slight toxicity signs were observed, contrarily to gamma irradiation where no detectable changes on cells were found. Ozonation in the presence of sugars avoided cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, some chemical alterations were observed in the nanoparticles.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Analysis of Pathological Activities of CCN2/CTGF in Muscle Dystrophy CCN2 or connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a matricellular protein that regulates several cellular processes. In skeletal muscle, CTGF is a key modulator of fibrogenesis, is increased in pathological conditions such as muscular dystrophies, and plays a major role in the pathology outcome. Overexpression of CTGF in skeletal muscle of wild-type mice results in muscle damage, fibrosis, and reduction of strength. In contrast, a decrease in CTGF in dystrophic mice increases strength and reduces damage and fibrosis. Thus, CTGF is a relevant target to study in skeletal muscle pathology and its possible modulation by different treatments or potential new drugs to develop new strategies for the treatment of muscular dystrophies. We summarize the techniques used to detect CTGF in the skeletal muscle of dystrophic mdx mice.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"AAV9 - NPC1 significantly ameliorates Purkinje cell death and behavioral abnormalities in mouse NPC disease Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 gene. There is no effective way to treat NPC disease. In this study, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9 (AAV9) to deliver a functional NPC1 gene systemically into NPC1(-/-) mice at postnatal day 4. One single AAV9-NPC1 injection resulted in robust NPC1 expression in various tissues, including brain, heart, and lung. Strikingly, AAV9-mediated NPC1 delivery significantly promoted Purkinje cell survival, restored locomotor activity and coordination, and increased the lifespan of NPC1(-/-) mice.

"Fine Mapping of Carbon Assimilation Rate 8, a Quantitative Trait Locus for Flag Leaf Nitrogen Content, Stomatal Conductance and Photosynthesis in Rice Increasing the rate of leaf photosynthesis is one important approach for increasing grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa). Exploiting the natural variation in CO2 assimilation rate (A) between rice cultivars using quantitative genetics is one promising means to identify genes contributing to higher photosynthesis. In this study, we determined precise location of Carbon Assimilation Rate 8 (CAR8) by crossing a high-yielding indica cultivar with a Japanese commercial cultivar. Fine mapping suggested that CAR8 encodes a putative Heme Activator Protein 3 (OsHAP3) subunit of a CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor called OsHAP3H. Sequencing analysis revealed that the indica allele of CAR8 has a 1-bp deletion at 322 bp from the start codon, resulting in a truncated protein of 125 amino acids. In addition, CAR8 is identical to DTH8 / Ghd8 / LHD1, which was reported to control rice flowering date. The increase of A is largely due to an increase of RuBP regeneration rate via increased leaf nitrogen content, and partially explained by reduced stomatal limitation via increased stomatal conductance relative to A. This allele also increases hydraulic conductivity, which would promote higher stomatal conductance. This indicates that CAR8 affects multiple physiological aspects relating to photosynthesis. The detailed analysis of molecular functions of CAR8 would help to understand the association between photosynthesis and flowering and demonstrate specific genetic mechanisms that can be exploited to improve photosynthesis in rice and potentially other crops.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Chemoprevention of spontaneous ovarian cancer in the domestic hen The hen is an attractive animal model for in vivo testing of agents that thwart ovarian carcinogenesis because ovarian cancer in the domestic hen features clinical and molecular alterations that are similar to ovarian cancer in humans, including a high incidence of p53 mutations. The objective of the study was to test the potential ovarian cancer chemopreventive effect of the p53 stabilizing compound CP-31398 on hens that spontaneously present the ovarian cancer phenotype. Beginning at 79 wk of age, 576 egg-laying hens (Gallus domesticus) were randomized to diets containing different amounts of CP-31398 for 94 wk, 5 d, comprising a control group (C) (n = 144), which was fed a diet containing 0 ppm (mg/kg) of CP-31398; a low-dose treatment (LDT) group (n = 144), which was fed a diet containing 100 ppm of CP-31398; a moderate-dose treatment (MDT) group (n = 144) which was fed a diet containing 200 ppm of CP-31398; and a high-dose treatment (HDT) group (n = 144), which was fed a diet containing 300 ppm of CP-31398. Hens were killed at 174 wk of age to determine the incidence of ovarian and oviductal adenocarcinomas. Whereas the incidence of localized and metastatic ovarian cancers in the MDT and HDT groups was significantly lower (up to 77%) compared to levels in the C and LDT groups (P < 0.05), the incidence of oviductal cancer was unaffected by CP-31398.

"Tibia stress fracture secondary to obsessive compulsive disorder Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Early-onset OCD is one of the most common mental illnesses of children and adolescents, with a prevalence of 1% to 3%. It is related to worse lifespan symptoms and prognosis. Therefore, the treatment of OCD in children and adolescent has gained importance. If it is not treated successfully, the compulsive behaviors may cause extreme stress for children and their parents. Although minor complications of OCD are commonly observed, major complications are considerably rare due to the nature of compulsive behaviors. Apparently, loss of vision, autocastration, rectal prolapse are examples of major complications secondary to OCD. As far as we know, it is the first case of tibia stress fracture secondary to OCD.

"Alanine Aminotransferase Is a Marker of Lipotoxicity Consequences and Hyperandrogenemia in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Several studies have reported higher levels of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with control subjects. Plasma ALT levels are considered a marker of hepatic lipotoxicity because of their significant associations with different hepatic metabolic dysfunctions, such as hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance. Retrospective chart review aiming to assess, in PCOS women, the relationship between ALT levels and measures of lipotoxicity consequences that are available clinically, both during fasting and using the oral glucose tolerance test. Women (n = 132) with PCOS, were in average 27.9 years of age, with a mean body mass index of 34.1 kg/m(2) and 49% had a metabolic syndrome (MetS). ALT levels were significantly correlated with homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (r = 0.42, P < 0.001), HDL-C (r = -0.31, P < 0.001), Matsuda index (-0.45, P < 0.001), insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 (-0.26, P = 0.043), and free testosterone (0.38, P < 0.001), but not with fasting glucose and triglyceride levels. ALT cutoff â¥24 IU/L was associated with all these parameters, including fasting glucose (P = 0.021) and triglyceride levels (P = 0.041), and detected more women with the MetS (59.2% vs. 36.1%, P = 0.008) and whole-body insulin resistance (Matsuda index <12.3 L(2)Â·10/mmol(2), 85.3% vs. 51.9%, P = 0.004). Plasma ALT levels seem to be a strong predictor not only of liver lipotoxicity but also of systemic lipotoxic consequences and hyperandrogenemia in women with PCOS. Although it requires validation in another study, an ALT cutoff of â¥24 IU/L may help clinicians identify women with increased metabolic risks.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Quantitative phase imaging by single-shot Hilbert-Huang phase microscopy We propose a novel single-shot Hilbert-Huang transform-based algorithm applied to digital holographic microscopy (DHM) for robust, fast, and accurate single-shot quantitative phase imaging in on-axis and off-axis configurations. Fringe pattern with possible defects and closed fringes are adaptively filtered and accurately phase demodulated using local fringe direction estimation. Experimental validation of the proposed techniques is presented as the DHM study of microbeads and red blood cells phase samples. Obtained results compare very favorably with the Fourier approach (off-axis) and temporal phase shifting (on-axis).",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride in caries prevention and arrest: a systematic literature review This study aimed to evaluate the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in preventing and arresting caries in the primary dentition and permanent first molars. A systematic review (SR) was performed by 2 independent reviewers using 3 electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus). The database search employed the following key words: "" topical fluorides "" AND "" children "" AND "" clinical trials ""; "" topical fluorides "" OR "" silver diamine fluoride "" AND "" randomized controlled trial ""; "" silver diamine fluoride "" AND "" children "" OR "" primary dentition "" AND "" tooth decay ""; "" silver diamine fluoride "" OR "" sodium fluoride varnish "" AND "" early childhood caries ""; and "" silver diamine fluoride "" AND "" children "". Inclusion criteria were articles published in English, from 2005 to January 2016, on clinical studies using SDF as a treatment intervention to evaluate caries arrest in children with primary dentition and/or permanent first molars. Database searches provided 821 eligible publications, of which 33 met the inclusion criteria. After the abstracts were prescreened, 25 articles were dismissed based on exclusion criteria. The remaining 8 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 7 publications were included in the SR. These included 1 study assessing the effectiveness of SDF at different concentrations; 3 studies comparing SDF with other interventions; 2 investigations comparing SDF at different application frequencies and with other interventions; and 1 study comparing semiannual SDF applications versus a control group. The literature indicates that SDF is a preventive treatment for dental caries in community settings. At concentrations of 30% and 38%, SDF shows potential as an alternative treatment for caries arrest in the primary dentition and permanent first molars. To establish guidelines, more studies are needed to fully assess the effectiveness of SDF and to determine the appropriate application frequency.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A Rasch Rating Scale Analysis of the Presence of Nursing Scale - RN The phenomenon of nursing presence encompasses the emotional connection between nurse and patient, and technical skills performed by the nurse. The Presence of Nursing Scale - RN version (PONS - RN) was developed to measure nurses' perceptions of their ability to be present to their patients. This study summarizes the process of re-evaluation of the psychometric properties of the PONS - RN instrument. A sample of 76 registered nurses providing direct patient care responded to the 31- item questionnaire. The Rasch rating scale model was used for assessing construct validity of PONS - RN data. A principal component analysis (PCA) of residuals supported appropriateness of the subscales defined by a 2-dimensional structure. The results of item and person fit analysis, rating scale functioning analysis and reliability analysis have demonstrated that the thirty-one item Presence of Nursing Scale - RN instrument yielded measures with high validity and reliability as two sub-scales.

"Route of Delivery in Women With Stillbirth: Results From the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network To describe delivery management of singleton stillbirths in a population-based, multicenter case series. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 611 women with singleton stillbirths at 20 weeks of gestation or greater from March 2006 to September 2008. Medical and delivery information was abstracted from medical records. Both antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths were included; these were analyzed both together and separately. The primary outcome was mode of delivery. Secondary outcomes included induction of labor and indications for cesarean delivery. Indications for cesarean delivery were classified as obstetric (abnormal fetal heart tracing before intrapartum demise, abruption, coagulopathy, uterine rupture, placenta previa, or labor dystocia) or nonobstetric (patient request, repeat cesarean delivery, or not documented). Of the 611 total cases of stillbirth, 93 (15.2%) underwent cesarean delivery, including 43.0% (46/107) of women with prior cesarean delivery and 9.3% (47/504) of women without prior cesarean delivery. No documented obstetric indication was evident for 38.3% (18/47) of primary and 78.3% (36/46) of repeat cesarean deliveries. Labor induction resulted in vaginal delivery for 98.5% (321/326) of women without prior cesarean delivery and 91.1% (41/45) of women with a history of prior cesarean delivery, including two women who had uterine rupture. Among women with a history of prior cesarean delivery who had spontaneous labor, 74.1% (20/27) delivered vaginally, with no cases of uterine rupture. Women with stillbirth usually delivered vaginally regardless of whether labor was spontaneous or induced or whether they had a prior cesarean delivery. However, 15% underwent cesarean delivery, often without a documented obstetric indication.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Race-related differences in tissue dielectric constant measured noninvasively at 300 MHz in male and female skin at multiple sites and depths We hypothesized that reported race-related differences in skin properties cause skin and skin-to-fat water differences among races that are measureable by skin tissue dielectric constant (TDC) values that depend strongly on water content. Our first aim was to test this hypothesis. Also, since inter-side TDC ratios are used to assess edema and lymphedema, the second aim was to test if TDC ratios are race -dependent. The third aim was to determine the extent to which TDC depends on total body water (TBW) and fat (TBF). Tissue dielectric constant was measured to 1.5 or 5.0 mm depths bilaterally on chest, forearm and ankle in 100 young (19-39 years) adults with 10 male and 10 female per self-expressed race. Races were African-American, Asian, Asian-Indian, Caucasian and Hispanic groups. TBW and TBF were measured using bioimpedance. Tissue dielectric constant values decreased from chest to forearm to ankle (P<.001) independent of race with most values greater for males but with inter-arm TDC ratios independent of gender, site, depth, or race. For females, forearm TDC values differed among races (P<.01) with Asian and Asian-Indian values tending to be least. For males, chest TDC values differed among races (P<.01) mainly due to large African-American TDC values. For the composite group, TDC was strongly (P<.001) positively correlated with TBW and negatively correlated with TBF. Tissue dielectric constant dependence on race of the type herein uncovered should be considered in assessing skin hydration comparisons that include different race or ethnic subjects. Further, the demonstrated relationship between TDC and body composition should be considered as an important covariate. However, despite these variations, the inter - arm TDC ratio remains robust as a potential indicator of unilateral tissue water changes.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Maternal depression attenuates newborn vitamin D concentrations in winter - spring: a prospective population-based study We aimed to investigate whether the newborns of mothers with maternal depression (MD) had lower vitamin D levels than newborns of non-MD (NMD) mothers and identify the potential mechanism underlying this association. Maternal depressive symptoms in late pregnancy and concentrations of cord blood 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured in 1491 mother - infant pairs. Data on maternal sociodemographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle and birth outcomes were prospectively collected. For infants born in winter - spring, the infants of MD mothers had significantly reduced concentrations of 25(OH) D (adjusted Î² = -3.51 nmol/L; 95% CI: -6.19, -0.84; P = 0.010) and lower birth weight (3267 Â± 470 g vs 3348 Â± 598 g, F = 4.64, P = 0.031), compared with the infants of NMD mothers. A significant, inverse linear relationship was noted between maternal depression scores and the concentration of 25(OH)D for infants born in winter - spring (adjusted Î² = -0.158; 95% CI: -0.259, -0.057). The significant, inverse linear relationship between maternal depression scores and fetomaternal ratios of 25(OH) D was also observed among the infants born in winter - spring (adjusted Î² = -0.005; 95% CI: -0.008, -0.003). MD appears to significantly attenuate the vitamin D concentrations and birth weight of infants born in winter - spring. A decreased fetomaternal ratio of 25(OH)D might be involved in this biological pathway.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Specific Lobar Affection Reveals a Rostrocaudal Gradient in Functional Outcome in Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage Several studies have reported a better functional outcome in lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) compared with deep location. However, among lobar ICH, a correlation of hemorrhage site -involving the specific lobes -with functional outcome has not been established. Conservatively treated patients with supratentorial ICH, admitted to our hospital over a 5-year period (2008-2012), were retrospectively analyzed. Lobar patients were classified as isolated or overlapping ICH according to affected lobes. Demographic, clinical, and radiological characteristics were recorded and compared among lobar ICH patients using above subclassification. Functional outcome -dichotomized into favorable (modified Rankin Scale, 0-3) and unfavorable (modified Rankin Scale, 4-6)-was assessed after 3 and 12 months. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for favorable outcome. Of overall 553 patients, 260 had lobar ICH. In isolated lobar ICH, median hematoma - volume decreased from rostral (frontal, 22.4 mL [7.3-55.5 mL]) to caudal (occipital, 7.1 mL [5.2-16.4 mL]; P=0.045), whereas the proportion of patients with favorable outcome increased (frontal: 23/63 [36.5%] versus occipital: 10/12 [83.3%]; P=0.003). Patients with overlapping lobar ICH had larger ICH volumes than isolated lobar ICH (overlapping, 48.9 mL [22.6-78.5 mL] versus 15.3 mL [5.0-44.6 mL]; P<0.001) and poorer clinical status on admission (Glasgow Coma Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale). Correlations with anatomic aspects provided evidence of a rostrocaudal gradient with increasing gray / white-matter ratio and decreasing hematoma -volume and rate of hematoma enlargement from frontal to occipital ICH location. Multivariate analysis revealed affection of occipital lobe (odds ratio, 3.75 [1.38-10.22]) and affection of frontal lobe (odds ratio, 0.52 [0.28-0.94]) to be independent predictors for favorable outcome and unfavorable outcome, respectively. Among patients with lobar ICH radiological and outcome characteristics differed according to location. Especially affection of the frontal lobe was frequent and associated with unfavorable outcome after 3 months.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Addressing reverse inference in psychiatric neuroimaging: Meta-analyses of task -related brain activation in common mental disorders Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in psychiatry use various tasks to identify case-control differences in the patterns of task -related brain activation. Differently activated regions are often ascribed disorder -specific functions in an attempt to link disease expression and brain function. We undertook a systematic meta-analysis of data from task - fMRI studies to examine the effect of diagnosis and study design on the spatial distribution and direction of case-control differences on brain activation. We mapped to atlas regions coordinates of case-control differences derived from 537 task - fMRI studies in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder comprising observations derived from 21,427 participants. The fMRI tasks were classified according to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). We investigated whether diagnosis, RDoC domain or construct and use of regions-of-interest or whole-brain analyses influenced the neuroanatomical pattern of results. When considering all primary studies, we found an effect of diagnosis for the amygdala and caudate nucleus and an effect of RDoC domains and constructs for the amygdala, hippocampus, putamen and nucleus accumbens. In contrast, whole-brain studies did not identify any significant effect of diagnosis or RDoC domain or construct. These results resonate with prior reports of common brain structural and genetic underpinnings across these disorders and caution against attributing undue specificity to brain functional changes when forming explanatory models of psychiatric disorders.

""" Predictors of provider - initiated HIV testing and counseling refusal by outpatient department clients in Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia: a case control study "" ""Despite different strategies designed to rapidly identify HIV infected individuals, majority of HIV -infected people are unaware of their sero-status in developing countries. The objective of this study was to assess predictors of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) refusal by outpatient department (OPD) clients in Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia. Facility based unmatched case control study was conducted on outpatient department clients in randomly selected seven health facilities in Wolaita zone, Southern Ethiopia in February 2012. A total of 291 participants (97 cases and 194 controls) were included in our study. Cases were patients who refused HIV test while controls were patients who tested for HIV after provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) recommendation by outpatient department (OPD) clinicians. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. Pretested interviewer administered questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data by trained nurses, and in-depth interview with 14 OPD clinicians was conducted by principal investigator to supplement quantitative findings. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to identify independent predictors of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling refusal by OPD clients. Study participants who had stigmatizing attitude [AOR =6.09, (95 % CI: 1.70, 21.76)], who had perceived risk for HIV infection [AOR =5.23, (95 % CI: 2.22, 12.32)], who did not perceive the benefits of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling [AOR =4.64, (95 % CI: 1.79, 12.01)], who did not get minimum recommended pretest information from their providers [AOR =2.98, (95 % CI: 1.06, 8.35)], who ever not heard of provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling service [AOR =2.41, (95 % CI: 1.14, 5.09)], and who were from urban area [AOR =2.40, (95 % CI =1.26, 4.57)] were more likely to refuse provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling service than their counterparts. Knowledge on HIV /AIDS, attitude towards people living with HIV /AIDS and perceived risk for HIV infection by clients were the major barriers for provider -initiated HIV testing and counseling acceptance. Health professionals working at outpatient department should give due attention to overcome these barriers so as to enhance HIV testing acceptance by their clients .""

"Extending ' Contact Tracing ' into the Community within a 50-Metre Radius of an Index Tuberculosis Patient Using Xpert MTB/RIF in Urban, Pakistan: Did It Increase Case Detection? Currently, only 62% of incident tuberculosis (TB) cases are reported to the national programme in Pakistan. Several innovative interventions are being recommended to detect the remaining 'missed' TB cases. One such intervention involved expanding contact investigation to the community using the Xpert MTB/RIF test. This was a before and after intervention study involving retrospective record review. Passive case finding and household contact investigation was routinely done in the pre- intervention period July 2011-June 2013. Four districts with a high concentration of slums were selected as intervention areas; Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Islamabad. Here, in the intervention period, July 2013-June 2015, contact investigation beyond household was conducted: all people staying within a radius of 50 metres (using Geographical Information System) from the household of smear positive TB patients were screened for tuberculosis. Those with presumptive TB were investigated using smear microscopy and the Xpert MTB/RIF test was performed on smear negative patients. All the diagnosed TB patients were linked to TB treatment and care. A total of 783043 contacts were screened for tuberculosis: 23741(3.0%) presumptive TB patients were identified of whom, 4710 (19.8%) all forms and 4084(17.2%) bacteriologically confirmed TB patients were detected. The contribution of Xpert MTB/RIF to bacteriologically confirmed TB patients was 7.6%. The yield among investigated presumptive child TB patients was 5.1%. The overall yield of all forms TB patients among investigated was 22.3% among household and 19.1% in close community. The intervention contributed an increase of case detection of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis by 6.8% and all forms TB patients by 7.9%. Community contact investigation beyond household not only detected additional TB patients but also increased TB case detection. However, further long term assessments and cost-effectiveness studies are required before national scale-up.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Prostate and Colorectal Cancer Screening Uptake among US and Foreign-Born Males: Evidence from the 2015 NHIS Survey Research suggests that prostate and colorectal cancers disproportionately affect men in the US, but little is known about the determinants of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake among US and foreign-born males. The purpose of this study was to investigate what factors influence prostate and colorectal cancer screening uptake among US-native born and foreign-born men. Using the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, we conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to highlight factors associated with the uptake of prostate and colorectal cancer screening among US-native born and foreign-born men. The sample size consisted of 5651 men respondents, with the mean age of 59.7 years (SD = 12.1). Of these, more than two-fifths (42%) were aged 50-64 years old. With respect to race / ethnicity, the sample was predominantly non-Hispanic Whites (65.5%), 863 (15.6%) Hispanics, and 710 (12.4%) Blacks. Our analysis found higher rates of both US-born and foreign-born men aged 65 years or older, who had either a PSA or CRC screening tests than those aged <65 years. Results of the general multivariate model suggest that men under 50 years old, US-born and foreign-born alike, are statistically significantly less likely to have prostate or colorectal cancer screenings than men aged 65 years or above.

"Comparison of Leishmania typing results obtained from 16 European clinical laboratories in 2014 Leishmaniasis is endemic in southern Europe, and in other European countries cases are diagnosed in travellers who have visited affected areas both within the continent and beyond. Prompt and accurate diagnosis poses a challenge in clinical practice in Europe. Different methods exist for identification of the infecting Leishmania species. Sixteen clinical laboratories in 10 European countries, plus Israel and Turkey, conducted a study to assess their genotyping performance. DNA from 21 promastigote cultures of 13 species was analysed blindly by the routinely used typing method. Five different molecular targets were used, which were analysed with PCR-based methods. Different levels of identification were achieved, and either the Leishmania subgenus, species complex, or actual species were reported. The overall error rate of strains placed in the wrong complex or species was 8.5%. Various reasons for incorrect typing were identified. The study shows there is considerable room for improvement and standardisation of Leishmania typing. The use of well validated standard operating procedures is recommended, covering testing, interpretation, and reporting guidelines. Application of the internal transcribed spacer 1 of the rDNA array should be restricted to Old World samples, while the heat-shock protein 70 gene and the mini-exon can be applied globally.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Behavioral Processes in Long-Lag Intervention Studies We argue that psychologists who conduct experiments with long lags between the manipulation and the outcome measure should pay more attention to behavioral processes that intervene between the manipulation and the outcome measure. Neglect of such processes, we contend, stems from psychology's long tradition of short-lag lab experiments where there is little scope for intervening behavioral processes. Studying process in the lab invariably involves studying psychological processes, but in long-lag field experiments it is important to study causally relevant behavioral processes as well as psychological ones. To illustrate the roles that behavioral processes can play in long-lag experiments we examine field experiments motivated by three policy -relevant goals: prejudice reduction, health promotion, and educational achievement. In each of the experiments discussed we identify various behavioral pathways through which the manipulated psychological state could have produced the observed outcome. We argue that if psychologists conducting long-lag interventions posited a theory of change that linked manipulated psychological states to outcomes via behavioral pathways, the result would be richer theory and more practically useful research. Movement in this direction would also permit more opportunities for productive collaborations between psychologists and other social scientists interested in similar social problems.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Haemoglobinopathies and Î²-Thalassaemia among the Tribals Working in the Tea Gardens of Assam, India Prevalence of haemoglobinopathies and Î²-thalassaemia are very high in India but information about its status among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam is very less. The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of haemoglobinopathies and Î²-thalassaemia among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. A total 1204 samples from the tribals working in tea gardens of Assam were analysed for both Complete Blood Count (CBC) and High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for detection of haemoglobinopathies and Î²-thalassaemia. This study showed that the prevalence of sickle cell anaemia and Î²-thalassaemia were very high among this population. Our results indicated a higher prevalence of Î²-thalassaemia (3.07%) among the Munda ethnic group and higher prevalence of sickle cell anaemia (4.73%) among the Lohar ethnic group. This was the first study to report the presence of HbE among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. Based on the present findings, sickle cell anaemia and Î²-thalassaemia were major health problem for the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. Proper diagnostic facilities for haemoglobinopathy and thalassaemia should be established in these areas, including establishment of haemoglobinopathy and thalassaemia database collection, haematological analysis laboratories, genetic counselling clinics, prenatal diagnosis centres and neonatal screening centres.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A novel quantitative PCR detects Babesia infection in patients not identified by currently available non-nucleic acid amplification tests Ticks transmit Babesia microti, the causative agents of babesiosis in North America and Europe. Babesiosis is now endemic in Northeastern USA and affects people of all ages. Babesia species infect erythrocytes and can be transmitted through blood transfusion. Whole blood and blood products, which are not tested for Babesia, can cause transfusion - transmitted babesiosis (TTB) resulting in severe consequences in the immuno-compromised patients. The purpose of this study was epidemiological evaluation of babesiosis in a tick-infested state. We examined blood samples from 192 patients who visited clinics during the active tick-borne diseases season, using a newly developed qPCR assay that uses the specific molecular beacon probe. Due to the absence of clear symptomology, clinical laboratories did not test 131 samples by IFA, FISH or microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears. Babesia infection was detected in all age groups by FISH and microscopy; notably patients >40 years of age represented 64% of tested samples and 13% were younger patients. We tested all samples using qPCR and found that 38% were positive for Babesia. Of 28 samples that were positive by FISH, 27 (96%) were also positive by qPCR indicating high congruency between nucleic acid based tests. Interestingly, of 78 asymptomatic samples not tested by FISH, 22 were positive by our qPCR. Direct detection of Babesia relies upon microscopic examination of patient blood smears, which is labor intensive, difficult to scale up, requires specific expertise and is hence, often not performed. In fact, a clinical laboratory examined only 23 of 86 blood samples obtained from two different counties by microscopy. By considering individuals positive for Babesia infection when results from currently available microscopy, FISH or serological tests were positive, we found that our qPCR is highly sensitive (96.2%) and showed a specificity of 70.5% for Babesia. Robust qPCR using specific probes can be highly useful for efficient and appropriate diagnosis of babesiosis in patients in conjunction with conventional diagnostics, or as a stand-alone test, especially for donated blood screening. The use of a nucleic acid amplification test based screening of blood and blood products could prevent TTB.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Towards culturally competent paediatric oncology care. A qualitative study from the perspective of care providers In order to gain more insight on the influence of ethnic diversity in paediatric cancer care, the perspectives of care providers were explored. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 12 paediatric oncologists and 13 nurses of two different paediatric oncology wards and were analysed using a framework method. We found that care providers described the contact with Turkish and Moroccan parents as more difficult. They offered two reasons for this: (1) language barriers between care provider and parents hindered the exchange of information; (2) cultural barriers between care provider and parents about sharing the diagnosis and palliative perspective hindered communication. Care providers reported different solutions to deal with these barriers, such as using an interpreter and improving their cultural knowledge about their patients. They, however, were not using interpreters sufficiently and were unaware of the importance of eliciting parents ' perspectives. Communication techniques to overcome dilemmas between parents and care providers were not used and care providers were unaware of stereotypes and prejudice. Care providers should be offered insight in cultural barriers they are unaware of. Training in cultural competence might be a possibility to overcome manifest barriers.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Trajectories of Health and Behavioral Health Services Use among Community Corrections -Involved Rural Adults This article seeks to establish time-based trajectories of health and behavioral health services utilization for community corrections-involved (CCI) adults and to examine demographic and clinical correlates associated with these trajectories. To accomplish this aim, the authors applied a latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to services use data from a sample of rural CCI adults who reported their medical, mental health, and substance use treatment utilization behavior every 60 days for 1.5 years. LCGA established 1.5-year trajectories and demographic correlates of health services among rural CCI adults. For medical services, three classes emerged (stable-low users, 13%; stable-intermediate users, 40%; and stable-high users, 47%). For mental health and substance use services, three classes emerged (stable-low, 69% and 61%, respectively; low-baseline-increase, 10% and 12%, respectively; high-baseline decline, 21% and 28%, respectively). Employment, gender, medication usage, and depression severity predicted membership across all services. Results underscore the importance of social workers and other community services providers aligning health services access with the needs of the CCI population, and highlight CCI adults as being at risk of underservice in critical prevention and intervention domains.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Interaction-driven distinctive electronic states of artificial atoms at the ZnO interface We have investigated the electronic states of planar quantum dots at the ZnO interface containing a few interacting electrons in an externally applied magnetic field. The electron-electron interaction effects are expected to be much stronger in this case than in traditional semiconductor quantum systems, such as in GaAs or InAs quantum dots. In order to highlight that stronger Coulomb effects in the ZnO quantum dots, we have compared the energy spectra and the magnetization in this system to those of the InAs quantum dots. We have found that in the ZnO quantum dots the signatures of stronger Coulomb interaction manifests in an unique ground state that has very different properties than the corresponding ones in the InAs dot. Our results for the magnetization also exhibits behaviors never before observed in a quantum dot for a realistic set of parameters. We have found a stronger temperature dependence and other unexpected features, such as paramagnetic-like behavior at high temperatures for a quantum-dot helium.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Toe Pressure and Toe Brachial Index are Predictive of Cardiovascular Mortality, Overall Mortality, and Amputation Free Survival in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease Peripheral haemodynamic parameters are used to assess the presence and severity of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The prognostic value of ankle brachial index (ABI) has been thoroughly delineated. Nonetheless, the relative usefulness of ankle pressure (AP), ABI, toe pressure (TP), and toe brachial index (TBI) in assessing patient outcome has not been investigated in a concurrent study setting. This study aimed to resolve the association of all four non-invasive haemodynamic parameters in clinically symptomatic patients with PAD with cardiovascular mortality, overall mortality, and amputation free survival (AFS). In total, 732 symptomatic patients with PAD admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery for conventional angiography at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, between January 2009 and August 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic factors, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and above foot level amputations were obtained and assessed in relation to AP, ABI, TP, and TBI by means of Kaplan-Meier life tables and a multivariate Cox regression model. The haemodynamic parameter that was associated with poor 36 month general outcome was TP < 30 mmHg. Univariate Cox regression analysis of stratified values showed that TP and TBI associated significantly with mortality. In multivariate analysis both TP and TBI were associated with a significant risk of death. For TP < 30 mmHg and TBI < 0.25 the risk of cardiovascular mortality was hazard ratio [HR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-4.61 [p<.001]; HR 3.68, 95% CI 1.48-9.19 [p=.050], respectively; all-cause mortality (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.44-2.92 [p<.001]; HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.35-4.74 [p=.040], respectively); and amputation or death (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.52-2.98 [p<.001]; HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.38-4.40 [p=.050], respectively)... Among non-invasive haemodynamic measurements and pressure indices both TP and TBI appear to be associated with cardiovascular and overall mortality and AFS for patients with PAD presenting symptoms of the disease.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Leptin receptor antagonism of iNKT cell function: a novel strategy to combat multiple myeloma A hallmark of bone marrow changes with aging is the increase in adipocyte composition, but how this impacts development of multiple myeloma (MM) is unknown. Here, we report the role of the adipokine leptin as master regulator of anti- myeloma tumor immunity by modulating the invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell function. A marked increase in serum leptin levels and leptin receptor (LR) expression on iNKT cells in MM patients and the 5T33 murine MM model was observed. MM cells and leptin synergistically counteracted anti-tumor functionality of both murine and human iNKT cells. In vivo blockade of LR signalling combined with iNKT stimulation resulted in superior anti-tumor protection. This was linked to persistent IFN-Î³ secretion upon repeated iNKT cell stimulation and a restoration of the dynamic antigen - induced motility arrest as observed by intravital microscopy, thereby showing alleviation of iNKT cell anergy. Overall our data reveal the LR axis as novel therapeutic target for checkpoint inhibition to treat MM .Leukemia accepted article preview online, 11 May 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2017.146.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Locating the Seventh Cervical Spinous Process: Development and Validation of a Multivariate Model Using Palpation and Personal Information The aim of this study was to develop and validate a multivariate prediction model, guided by palpation and personal information, for locating the seventh cervical spinous process (C7SP). A single-blinded, cross-sectional study at a primary to tertiary health care center was conducted for model development and temporal validation. One-hundred sixty participants were prospectively included for model development (n = 80) and time-split validation stages (n = 80). The C7SP was located using the thorax-rib static method (TRSM). Participants underwent chest radiography for assessment of the inner body structure located with TRSM and using radio-opaque markers placed over the skin. Age, sex, height, body mass, body mass index, and vertex-marker distanc e (DV-M) were used to predict the distance from the C7SP to the vertex (DV-C7). Multivariate linear regression modeling, limits of agreement plot, histogram of residues, receiver operating characteristic curves, and confusion tables were analyzed. The multivariate linear prediction model for DV-C7 (in centimeters) was DV-C7 = 0.986DV-M + 0.018(mass) + 0.014(age) - 1.008. Receiver operating characteristic curves had better discrimination of DV-C7 (area under the curve = 0.661; 95% confidence interval = 0.541-0.782; P = .015) than DV-M (area under the curve = 0.480; 95% confidence interval = 0.345-0.614; P = .761), with respective cutoff points at 23.40 cm (sensitivity = 41%, specificity = 63%) and 24.75 cm (sensitivity = 69%, specificity = 52%). The C7SP was correctly located more often when using predicted DV-C7 in the validation sample than when using the TRSM in the development sample: n = 53 (66%) vs n = 32 (40%), P < .001. Better accuracy was obtained when locating the C7SP by use of a multivariate model that incorporates palpation and personal information.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Spinal load in nurses during emergency lifting of obese patients: preliminary results Nurses are exposed to the risk of injury while handling patients. This is particularly true for obese patients. The goal of this paper is to estimate the spinal loads and the related risk of injury to nurses while lifting obese patients from the floor with a bariatric sheet during a hospital emergency. Six male nurses participated in this study. The biomechanical analysis focused on the lifting strategy. Thirty obese in-patients were enrolled to take part in the experimental study and divided into three groups according to their Body Mass Index (BMI). Three-dimensional motion analysis was conducted using an optoelectronic system. The trunk kinematics and the loading on the spines of the operating nurses were computed. Our data showed that when the nurse was operating from the central handle, his trunk was more flexed at the end of the lift with a reduced range of motion. The values were higher when the nurse lifted patients with higher BMIs. All kinetic parameters and tension in the lumbar muscles at the end of the movement were characterised by lower values for the nurse placed beside the patient's head or feet if compared to the operator positioned beside the central handle in all patient groups. Our preliminary data suggest that only the reaction load on the spine of the nurse holding the central handle, closest to the patient's centre of mass, seems to exceed the recommended safety limits.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Clinical and radiological outcome following pneumothorax after endoscopic lung volume reduction with valves Valve implantation has evolved as a therapy for patients with advanced emphysema. Although it is a minimally invasive treatmen t, it is associated with complications, the most common being pneumothorax. Pneumothorax occurs due to the rapid target lobe volume reduction and may be a predictor of clinical benefit despite this complication. The objective of this study was to conduct an exploratory data analysis of patients who developed a pneumothorax following endoscopic valve therapy for emphysema. This study performed a retrospective evaluation of pneumothorax management and the impact of pneumothorax on clinical outcomes in 70 patients following valve therapy in 381 consecutive patients. Pneumothorax rate following valve therapy was 18%. Pneumothorax management consisted of chest tube insertion, valve removal, and surgical intervention in 87% (61/70), 44% (31/70), and 19% (13/70) of the patients, respectively. Despite pneumothorax, patients experienced modest but significant improvements in lung function parameters (forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 55Â±148 mL, residual volume: -390Â±964 mL, total lung capacity: -348Â±876; all P<0.05). Persistent lobar atelectasis 3 months after recovering from pneumothorax, which was associated with relevant clinical improvement, was observed in only 21% (15/70) of the patients. Pneumothorax is a frequent severe complication following valve therapy that requires further intervention. Nevertheless, the pneumothorax does not impair the clinical status in the majority of patients. Patients with lobar atelectasis benefit after recovering from pneumothorax in terms of lung function parameters.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Teaching Genetic Counseling Skills: Incorporating a Genetic Counseling Adaptation Continuum Model to Address Psychosocial Complexity Genetic counselors are trained health care professionals who effectively integrate both psychosocial counseling and information-giving into their practice. Preparing genetic counseling students for clinical practice is a challenging task, particularly when helping them develop effective and active counseling skills. Resistance to incorporating these skills may stem from decreased confidence, fear of causing harm or a lack of clarity of psycho-social goals. The author reflects on the personal challenges experienced in teaching genetic counselling students to work with psychological and social complexity, and proposes a Genetic Counseling Adaptation Continuum model and methodology to guide students in the use of advanced counseling skills.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Evolution of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza: sequence data indicate stepwise changes in the cleavage site The genetic composition of an H5 subtype hemagglutinin gene quasispecies, obtained from ostrich tissues that had been infected with H5 subtype influenza virus was analysed using a next generation sequencing approach. The first evidence for the reiterative copying of a poly (U) stretch in the connecting peptide region in the haemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is provided. Multiple non-consensus species of RNA were detected in the infected host, corresponding to likely intermediate sequences between the putative low pathogenic precursor nucleotide sequence of the H5 influenza strain and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus gene sequence. In silico analysis of the identified RNA sequences predicted that the intermediary H5 sequence PQREKRGLF plays an important role in subsequent mutational events that relocate the HACS coding region from stable base-paired RNA regions to a single-stranded bulge, thereby priming the connecting peptide coding region for RdRp slippage.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Palmoplantar pustulosis - a cross-sectional analysis in Germany Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a recalcitrant chronic inflammatory skin disease. Data relevant for the medical care of patients with PPP are scarce. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the disease burden, clinical characteristics, and comorbidity of PPP patients in Germany. PPP patients were examined in a crosssectional study at seven specialized psoriasis centers in Germany. Of the 172 included patients with PPP, 79.1% were female and 69.8% were smokers .In addition, 25.0% suffered from psoriasis vulgaris, 28.2% had documented psoriatic arthritis, and 30.2% had a family history of psoriasis. In 77 patients the mean Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was 12.2 Â± 7.7 (mean Â± SD). The mean Psoriasis Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) was 12.6 Â± 8.6. Mean body mass index was above average at 27.1 Â± 5.5. The PPP patients had previously received an average of 2.6 Â± 2.1 different anti-psoriatic systemic drugs or UV-therapies. The systemic drugs that had been used most frequently were corticosteroids in 40.1% of patients, followed by acitretin (37.8%), and methotrexate (27.9%). The PPPASI was 13.4 Â± 8.9 in patients without current systemic therapy and 10.4 Â± 7.9 in patients with systemic therapy. Many PPP patients had a concomitant diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris and/or psoriatic arthritis or had a family history of psoriasis. Despite the fact that many of the patients were using anti-psoriatic therapies, there was still a high burden of disease within this PPP cohort. This insufficient control of symptoms demonstrates the urgent need for new PPP treatments.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Green and rapid synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Borago officinalis leaf extract: anticancer and antibacterial activities This study highlights the facile, reliable, cost effective, and ecofriendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Borago officinalis leaves extract efficiently. The biosynthesis of AgNPs was verified by UV-Vis spectrum which showed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 422 nm. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis revealed that the particles were spherical, hexagonal, and irregular in shape and had size ranging from 30 to 80 nm. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and elemental mapping have displayed the purity and maximum distribution of silver in the AgNPs. The crystalline nature of AgNPs had been identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area diffraction pattern (SAED). The particle size analysis revealed that the Z-average diameter of the AgNPs was 50.86 nm with polydispersity index (PDI) 0.136. Zeta potential analysis displayed the colloidal stability of AgNPs. This work also showed the efficacy of AgNPs against lung cancer cell lines (A549) and cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), in vitro. The AgNPs showed cytotoxicity to the A549 and HeLa cancer cell line at the concentrations 5 and 2 Î¼g/ml. The AgNPs were also explored for the antibacterial activity including biofilm inhibition against pathogenic bacteria. The B. officinalis leaves extract can be used efficiently for green synthesis AgNPs. The biosynthesized AgNPs demonstrated potentials as anticancer and antibacterial agents. This work provides helpful insight into the development of new anticancer and antimicrobial agents.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Atypical microglial response to biodiesel exhaust in healthy and hypertensive rats Accumulating evidence suggests a deleterious role for urban air pollution in central nervous system (CNS) diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells and sentinels in the brain, are a common source of neuroinflammation and are implicated in air pollution - induced CNS effects. While renewable energy, such as soy-based biofuel, is of increasing public interest, there is little information on how soy biofuel may affect the brain, especially in people with preexisting disease conditions. To address this, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were exposed to 100% Soy-based Biodiesel Exhaust (100SBDE; 0, 50, 150 and 500Î¼g/m(3)) by inhalation, 4h/ day for 4 weeks (5 days / week). Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (IBA-1) staining of microglia in the substantia nigra revealed significant changes in morphology with 100SBDE exposure in rats from both genotypes, where SHR were less sensitive. Aconitase activity was inhibited in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of WKY rats exposed to 100SBDE. No consistent changes occurred in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, nitrated protein, or arginase1 expression in brain regions from either rat strain exposed to 100SBDE. However, while IBA-1 mRNA expression was not modified, CX3CR1 mRNA expression was lower in the striatum of 100SBDE exposed rats regardless of genotype, suggesting a downregulation of the fractalkine receptor on microglia in this brain region. Together, these data indicate that while microglia are detecting and responding to 100SBDE exposure with changes in morphology, there is reduced expression of CX3CR1 regardless of genetic background and the activation response is atypical without traditional inflammatory markers of M1 or M2 activation in the brain.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Protective effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) via Nrf2 pathway against oxalate -induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular cells This study evaluated effect of oxalate on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and potential anti-fibrotic property of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). MDCK renal tubular cells were incubated with 0.5 mM sodium oxalate for 24-h with/without 1-h pretreatment with 25 Î¼M EGCG. Microscopic examination, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining revealed that oxalate -treated cells gained mesenchymal phenotypes by fibroblast -like morphological change and increasing expression of vimentin and fibronectin, while levels of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, occludin, cytokeratin and ZO-1) were decreased. EGCG pretreatment could prevent all these changes and molecular mechanisms underlying the prevention by EGCG were most likely due to reduced production of intracellular ROS through activation of Nrf2 signaling and increased catalase anti-oxidant enzyme. Knockdown of Nrf2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated all the effects of EGCG, confirming that the EGCG protection against oxalate -induced EMT was mediated via Nrf2. Taken together, our data indicate that oxalate turned on EMT of renal tubular cells that could be prevented by EGCG via Nrf2 pathway. These findings also shed light onto development of novel therapeutics or preventive strategies of renal fibrosis in the future.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A convergent synthesis of novel alkyne-azide cycloaddition congeners of betulinic acid as potent cytotoxic agent In an endeavour to develop potent anti-tumor agents from betulinic acid (BA), a series of C-28 derived 1,2,3-triazolyl derivatives were designed and synthesized by employing Cu(I) catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. All the derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxic activity by MTT assay against five different human cancer cell lines: lung (A549), colon (HCT116), prostate (PC3), pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and breast (T47D). The data revealed that compounds 11c, 11d, 11g, 11h and 13a possess most promising cytotoxic potential. The compound 11h was one of the most active compounds, with IC50 values in the range of 4-6ÂµM against all the five cancer cell lines. The results of this study suggested that derivatives with free -OH (11c, 11d and 11g) and free -COOH (11h and 13a) substitutions in the triazole moiety introduced at the C-28 position significantly improved the anti-tumor activity and may be the favourable position to synthesize potent anticancer leads from BA. Introduction of a non polar alkyl groups at C-28 position (10, 12 and 14) resulted in the significant loss of the activity. Further, DAPI staining, ROS generation and wound healing experiments revealed that compound 11h induces apoptosis in HCT-116 cells.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The FLASHE Study: Survey Development, Dyadic Perspectives, and Participant Characteristics The National Cancer Institute developed the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) Study to examine multiple cancer preventive behaviors within parent - adolescent dyads. The purpose of creating FLASHE was to enable the examination of physical activity, diet, and other cancer preventive behaviors and potential correlates among parent - adolescent dyads. FLASHE surveys were developed from a process involving literature reviews, scientific input from experts in the field, cognitive testing, and usability testing. This cross-sectional, web-based study of parents and their adolescent children (aged 12-17 years) was administered between April and October 2014. The nationwide sample consisted of 1,573 parent - adolescent dyads (1,699 parents and 1,581 adolescents) who returned all FLASHE surveys. FLASHE assessed parent and adolescent reports of several intrapersonal and interpersonal domains (including psychosocial variables, parenting, and the community and home environments). On a subset of example FLASHE items across these domains, responses of parents and adolescents within the same dyads were positively and significantly correlated (r =0.32-0.63). Analyses were run in 2015-2016. FLASHE data present multiple opportunities for studying research questions among individuals or dyads, including the ability to examine similarity between parents and adolescents on many constructs relevant to cancer preventive behaviors. FLASHE data are publicly available for researchers and practitioners to help advance research on cancer preventive health behaviors.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Evaluating the effectiveness of a mock oral educational program To obtain board certification, the American Board of Surgery requires graduates of general surgery training programs to pass both the written qualifying examination (QE) and the oral certifying examination (CE). In 2015, the pass rates for the QE and CE were 80% and 77%, respectively. In the 2011-2012 academic year, the University of Wisconsin instituted a mandatory, faculty-led, monthly CE preparation educational program (CE prep) as a supplement to their existing annual mock oral examination. We hypothesized that the implementation of these sessions would improve the first-time pass rate for residents taking the ABS CE at our institution. Secondary outcomes studied were QE pass rate, correlation with American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) and mock oral examination scores, cost, and type of study materials used, perception of examination difficulty, and applicant preparedness. A sixteen question survey was sent to 57 of 59 residents who attended the University of Wisconsin between the years of 2007 and 2015. Email addresses for two former residents could not be located. De-identified data for the ABSITE and first-time pass rates for the QE and CE examination were retrospectively collected and analyzed along with survey results. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Survey response rate was 77.2%. Of the residents who have attempted the CE, first-time pass rate was 76.0% (19 of 25) before the implementation of the formal CE Prep and 100% (22 of 22) after (P = 0.025). Absolute ABSITE score, and mock oral annual examination grades were significantly improved after the CE Prep was initiated (P values < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively), however, ABSITE percentile was not significantly different (P = 0.415). ABSITE raw score and percentile, as well as mock oral annual examination scores were significantly associated with passing the QE (0.032, 0.027, and 0.020, respectively), whereas mock oral annual examination scores alone were associated with passing the CE (P = 0.001). Survey results showed that residents perceived the CE to be easier than the annual mock oral after the institution of the CE prep course (P = 0.036), however, there was no difference in their perception of preparedness. Overall, applicants felt extremely prepared for the CE (4.70 Â± 0.5, Likert scale 1-5). Formal educational programs instituted during residency can improve resident performance on the ABS certifying examination. The institution of a formal, faculty-led monthly CE preparation educational program at the University of Wisconsin has significantly improved the first-time pass rate for the ABS CE. Mock oral annual examination scores were also significantly improved. Furthermore, ABSITE scores correlate with QE pass rates, and mock oral annual examination scores correlate with pass rates for both QE and CE.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Relationship Between Frequent Recreational Cannabis (Marijuana and Hashish) Use and Periodontitis in Adults in the United States: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011 to 2012 Recreational use of cannabis, following its legalization in some countries, poses emergent oral and periodontal health concerns. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between frequent recreational cannabis (FRC) (marijuana and hashish) use and periodontitis prevalence among adults in the United States. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011 to 2012 were analyzed. Primary outcome (periodontitis) was defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention / American Academy of Periodontology classification as well as continuous measurements of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (AL). Exposure of interest was self-reported cannabis use, defined as "" FRC use "" versus "" non-FRC use ."" Bivariate and multivariable regression models were performed using the entire analytical sample (model 1) as well as those who had never used tobacco (never-users) (model 2). Of 1,938 participants with available cannabis use data and essential covariates, 26.8% were FRC users. Mean number of sites per participant with PD â¥4, â¥6, and â¥8 mm and AL â¥3, â¥5, and â¥8 mm was significantly higher among FRC users than among non-FRC users (mean difference in number of PD sites: 6.9, 5.6, and 5.6; P <0.05; mean difference in number of AL sites: 12.7, 7.6, and 5.6; P <0.05). Average AL was higher among FRC users than among non-FRC users (1.8 versus 1.6 mm; P = 0.004). Bivariate analysis revealed positive (harmful) association between FRC use and severe periodontitis in the entire sample (odds ratio [OR]: 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3 to 2.4; P = 0.002) as well as in never-smokers (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2 to 3.5; P = 0.01). This association was retained in multivariable models adjusted for demographics (age, sex, race / ethnicity, and income level), alcohol and tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and past periodontal treatment (model 1: adjusted OR [aOR]: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.9; P = 0.07; model 2: aOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1 to 3.2; P = 0.03).

"Distinct Abnormalities of Small Bowel and Regional Colonic Volumes in Subtypes of Irritable Bowel Syndrome Revealed by MRI Non-invasive biomarkers which identify different mechanisms of disease in subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) could be valuable. Our aim was to seek useful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters that could distinguish each IBS subtypes. 34 healthy volunteers (HV), 30 IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), 16 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), and 11 IBS with mixed bowel habit (IBS-M) underwent whole-gut transit and small and large bowel volumes assessment with MRI scans from t=0 to t=360 min. Since the bowel frequency for IBS-M were similar to IBS-D, IBS-M and IBS-D were grouped together and labeled as IBS non-constipation group (IBS-nonC). Median (interquartile range): fasting small bowel water content in IBS-nonC was 21 (10-42), significantly less than HV at 44 ml (15-70), P<0.01 as was the postprandial area under the curve (AUC) P<0.01. The fasting transverse colon volumes in IBS-C were significantly larger at 253 (200-329) compared with HV, IBS-nonC whose values were 165 (117-255) and 198 (106-270) ml, respectively, P=0.02. Whole-gut transit time for IBS-C was prolonged at 69 (51-111), compared with HV at 34 (4-63) and IBS-D at 34 (17-78) h, P=0.03. Bloating score (VAS 0-10 cm) correlated with transverse colon volume at t=405 min, Spearman r=0.21, P=0.04.

"Panitumumab -Associated Encephalopathy after Accidental Intra-arterial Application through Dislocated Central Venous Access Device Acute central nervous system (CNS) toxicity and immune -related side effects are increasingly recognized with the use of monoclonal antibodies for cancer therapy. Here, we report a patient who developed of acute-onset encephalopathy and coma, which began shortly after administration of panitumumab for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed that the drug had been infused into the left cardiac ventricle via a dislocated central venous line. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging disclosed multiple cortical hyperintensities, which were preferentially located in the frontal lobes. While the neurological condition improved within a few days, the patient died 4 weeks later. It seems likely that the administration of the antibody via the intra-arterial route contributed to the development of this condition. Toxic encephalopathy may be a hitherto unrecognized complication of panitumumab treatment and should be taken into consideration in patients developing CNS symptoms undergoing this therapy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 regulates the early differentiation of cardiomyocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells Mitochondria are crucial for maintaining the properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and for regulating their subsequent differentiation into diverse cell lineages, including cardiomyocytes. However, mitochondrial regulators that manage the rate of differentiation or cell fate have been rarely identified. This study aimed to determine the potential mitochondrial factor that controls the differentiation of ESCs into cardiac myocytes. We induced cardiomyocyte differentiation from mouse ESCs (mESCs) and performed microarray assays to assess messenger RNA (mRNA) expression changes at differentiation day 8 (D8) compared with undifferentiated mESCs (D0). Among the differentially expressed genes, Pdp1 expression was significantly decreased (27-fold) on D8 compared to D0, which was accompanied by suppressed mitochondrial indices, including ATP levels, membrane potential, ROS and mitochondrial Ca(2+). Notably, Pdp1 overexpression significantly enhanced the mitochondrial indices and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and reduced the expression of cardiac differentiation marker mRNA and the cardiac differentiation rate compared to a mock control. In confirmation of this, a knockdown of the Pdp1 gene promoted the expression of cardiac differentiation marker mRNA and the cardiac differentiation rate. In conclusion, our results suggest that mitochondrial PDP1 is a potential regulator that controls cardiac differentiation at an early differentiation stage in ESCs.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Heterogeneous depression trajectories in multiple sclerosis patients Trajectories of depression over time may be heterogeneous in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Describing these trajectories will help clinicians understand better the progression of depression in MS patients to aid in patient care decisions. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was applied to 3507 MS patients using an electronic health records (EHR) data base to identify subgroups of MS patients based on self-reported depression screening (PHQ-9). Latent trajectory classes were used for group comparisons based on baseline clinical characteristics. Three subgroups were found characterized by high (10.0% [of participants]), wavering above and below moderate (26.2%) and low and variable (63.8%) depression level trajectories. The subpopulation trajectories, respectively, were also characterized by high, moderate and low MS disability at baseline. In contrast, the overall average trajectory was slightly declining and below the moderate depression threshold. The LCGA approach described in this paper and applied to MS patients provides a template for improved use of an EHR data base for understanding heterogeneous depression screening trajectories. Clinicians may use such information to more closely monitor patients that are expected to maintain high or unstable depression levels.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence in the Portuguese population: comparison of three cross-sectional studies spanning three decades Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan infecting up to one-third of the world's population, constituting a life threat if transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy.

We studied the seroprevalence trends in the Portuguese general population over the past 3 decades, by assessing chronological spread cross-sectional studies, with special focus on women of childbearing age, by age group, region and gender. The T. gondii overall seroprevalence decreased from 47% in 1979/1980 to 22% (95% CI 20% to 24%) in 2013. Generally, we observed that the prevalence of T. gondii IgG increased significantly with age and it decreased over time, both in the general population and in the childbearing women (18% prevalence in 2013). The scenario observed for the latter indicates that more than 80% of childbearing women are susceptible to primary infection yielding a risk of congenital toxoplasmosis and respective sequelae. Since there is no vaccine to prevent human toxoplasmosis, the improvement of primary prevention constitutes a major tool to avoid infection in such susceptible groups.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Association of physical activity on body composition, cardiometabolic risk factors, and prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the Korean population (from the fifth Korea national health and nutrition examination survey, 2008-2011) Data regarding associations among physical activity (PA) level, body composition, and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in Asian populations are rare. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was utilized to estimate PA levels and analyze the association of PA level with various body composition parameters and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases by using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2008 to 2011. Moderate and high PA levels were associated with lower prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and lower concentrations of serum ferritin, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase. Sarcopenia (low vs. moderate vs. high PA group: 14.3% vs. 10.5% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.001), underweight (5.7% vs. 4.9% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.001), and central obesity (7.8% vs. 6.9% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.002) were more often observed in the low PA group. The prevalence rates of cardiovascular diseases were lower in the moderate (odds ratio [OR], 0.822; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.737-0.916; p = 0.001) and high activity groups (OR, 0.663; 95% CI, 0.589-0.748; p = 0.001) than in the low activity group, even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, underlying disease, and general or abdominal obesity and muscle mass. Regular physical activity was associated with a low prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (stroke, myocardial infarction, stable angina, and chronic renal disease), which was independent of body composition and conventional risk factors in the Korean population, with a positive dose-response relationship.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Differential Apoptosis Radiosensitivity of Neural Progenitors in Adult Mouse Hippocampus Mammalian tissue-specific stem cells and progenitors demonstrate differential DNA damage response. Neural progenitors in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are known to undergo apoptosis after irradiation. Using a mouse model of hippocampal neuronal development, we characterized the apoptosis sensitivity of the different neural progenitor subpopulations in adult mouse dentate gyrus after irradiation. Two different bromodeoxyuridine incorporation paradigms were used for cell fate mapping. We identified two apoptosis sensitive neural progenitor subpopulations after irradiation. The first represented non-proliferative and non-newborn neuroblasts and immature neurons that expressed doublecortin, calretinin or both. The second consisted of proliferative intermediate neural progenitors. The putative radial glia-like neural stem cells or type-1 cells, regardless of proliferation status, were apoptosis resistant after irradiation. There was no evidence of radiation - induced apoptosis in the absence of the Trp53 (p53) gene but absence of Cdkn1a (p21) did not alter the apoptotic response. Upregulation of nuclear p53 was observed in neuroblasts after irradiation. We conclude that adult hippocampal neural progenitors may demonstrate differential p53 -dependent apoptosis sensitivity after irradiation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A Strategy to Establish a Quality Assurance / Quality Control Plan for the Application of Biosensors for the Detection of E. coli in Water Rapid bacterial detection using biosensors is a novel approach for microbiological testing applications. Validation of such methods is an obstacle in the adoption of new bio-sensing technologies for water testing. Therefore, establishing a quality assurance and quality control (QA / QC) plan is essential to demonstrate accuracy and reliability of the biosensor method for the detection of E. coli in drinking water samples. In this study, different reagents and assay conditions including temperatures, holding time, E. coli strains and concentrations, dissolving agents, salinity and pH effects, quality of substrates of various suppliers of 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide (MUG), and environmental water samples were included in the QA / QC plan and used in the assay optimization and documentation. Furthermore, the procedural QA / QC for the monitoring of drinking water samples was established to validate the performance of the biosensor platform for the detection of E. coli using a culture -based standard technique. Implementing the developed QA / QC plan, the same level of precision and accuracy was achieved using both the standard and the biosensor methods. The established procedural QA / QC for the biosensor will provide a reliable tool for a near real-time monitoring of E. coli in drinking water samples to both industry and regulatory authorities.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Ick Ciliary Kinase Is Essential for Planar Cell Polarity Formation in Inner Ear Hair Cells and Hearing Function Cellular asymmetries play crucial roles in development and organ function. The planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway is involved in the establishment of cellular asymmetry within the plane of a cell sheet. Inner ear sensory hair cells (HCs), which have several rows of staircase-like stereocilia and one kinocilium located at the vertex of the stereocilia protruding from the apical surface of each HC, exhibit a typical form of PCP. Although connections between cilia and PCP signaling in vertebrate development have been reported, their precise nature is not well understood. During inner ear development, several ciliary proteins are known to play a role in PCP formation. In the current study, we investigated a functional role for intestinal cell kinase (Ick), which regulates intraflagellar transport (IFT) at the tip of cilia, in the mouse inner ear. A lack of Ick in the developing inner ear resulted in PCP defects in the cochlea, including misorientation or misshaping of stereocilia and aberrant localization of the kinocilium and basal body in the apical and middle turns, leading to auditory dysfunction. We also observed abnormal ciliary localization of Ift88 in both HCs and supporting cells. Together, our results show that Ick ciliary kinase is essential for PCP formation in inner ear HCs, suggesting that ciliary transport regulation is important for PCP signaling .SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The cochlea in the inner ear is the hearing organ. Planar cell polarity (PCP) in hair cells (HCs) in the cochlea is essential for mechanotransduction and refers to the asymmetric structure consisting of stereociliary bundles and the kinocilium on the apical surface of the cell body. We reported previously that a ciliary kinase, Ick, regulates intraflagellar transport (IFT). Here, we found that loss of Ick leads to abnormal localization of the IFT component in kinocilia, PCP defects in HCs, and hearing dysfunction. Our study defines the association of ciliary transport regulation with PCP formation in HCs and hearing function.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Terahertz identification and quantification of neurotransmitter and neurotrophy mixture Terahertz spectroscopy has been widely used for investigating the fingerprint spectrum of different substances. For cancerous tissues, the greatest difficulty is the absorption peaks of various substances contained in tissues overlap with each other, which are hard to identify and quantitative analyze. As a result, it is very hard to measure the presence of cancer cell and then to diagnose accurately. In this paper, we select three typical neurotransmitters (Î³-aminobutyric acid, L-glutamic acid, dopamine hydrochloride) and two typical metabolites (inositol and creatine) in neurons to measure their terahertz spectra with different mixture ratios. By choosing characteristic absorption peaks, removing baseline and using the least square method, we can identify the components and proportions of each mixture, where the goodness of fit to practical situation is up to 94%. These results provide important evidences for identifying nerve substances and obtaining exact quantitative analysis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Propensity - matched Analysis of Outcomes and Hospital Charges for Anterior Versus Posterior Cervical Fusion for Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy Retrospective analysis of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a nationally representative, all-payer database of inpatient diagnoses and procedures in the United States. The objective of this study is to compare anterior cervical fusion (ACF) to posterior cervical fusion (PCF) in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Previous studies used retrospective single - institution level data to quantify outcomes for CSM patients fusion. It is unclear whether ACF or PCF is superior with regards to charges or outcomes for the treatment of CSM. We used Nationwide Inpatient Sample data to compare ACF to PCF in the management of CSM. All patients 18 years or older with a diagnosis of CSM between 1998 and 2011 were included. ACF patients were matched to PCF patients using propensity scores based on patient characteristics (number of levels fused, spine alignment, comorbidities), hospital characteristics, and patient demographics. Multivariable regression was used to measure the effect of treatment assignment on in- hospital charges, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, and dysphagia diagnosis. From 1998 to 2011, we identified 109,728 hospitalizations with a CSM diagnosis. Of these patients, 45,629 (41.6%) underwent ACF and 14,439 (13.2%) underwent PCF. The PCF cohort incurred an average of $41,683 more in-hospital charges (P<0.001, inflation adjusted to 2011 dollars) and remained in hospital an average of 2.4 days longer (P<0.001) than the ACF cohort. The ACF cohort was just as likely to die in the hospital [odds ratio 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.68-1.2], 3.0 times more likely to be discharged to home or self-care (95% CI, 2.9-3.2), and 2.5 times more likely to experience dysphagia (95% CI, 2.0-3.1) than the PCF cohort. In treating CSM, ACF led to lower hospital charges, shorter hospital stays, and an increased likelihood of being discharged to home relative to PCF.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Rehabilitation After Hamstring-Strain Injury Emphasizing Eccentric Strengthening at Long Muscle Lengths: Results of Long-Term Follow-Up Hamstring-strain injuries have a high recurrence rate. To determine if a protocol emphasizing eccentric strength training with the hamstrings in a lengthened position resulted in a low recurrence rate. Longitudinal cohort study. Sports-medicine physical therapy clinic. Fifty athletes with hamstring-strain injury (age 36 Â± 16 y; 30 men, 20 women; 3 G1, 43 G2, 4 G3; 25 recurrent injuries) followed a 3-phase rehabilitation protocol emphasizing eccentric strengthening with the hamstrings in a lengthened position. Injury recurrence; isometric hamstring strength at 80Â°, 60Â°, 40Â°, and 20Â° knee flexion in sitting with the thigh flexed to 40Â° above the horizontal and the seat back at 90Â° to the horizontal (strength tested before return to sport). Four of the 50 athletes sustained reinjuries between 3 and 12 mo after return to sport (8% recurrence rate). The other 42 athletes had not sustained a reinjury at an average of 24 Â± 12 mo after return to sport. Eight noncompliant athletes did not complete the rehabilitation and returned to sport before initiating eccentric strengthening in the lengthened state. All 4 reinjuries occurred in these noncompliant athletes. At time of return to sport, compliant athletes had full restoration of strength while noncompliant athletes had significant hamstring weakness, which was progressively worse at longer muscle lengths (compliance Ã side Ã angle P = .006; involved vs noninvolved at 20Â°, compliant 7% stronger, noncompliant 43% weaker).

"Subchondral bone microarchitecture and failure mechanism under compression: A finite element study Subchondral bone (SCB) microdamage is commonly observed in traumatic joint injuries and has been strongly associated with post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Knowledge of the three-dimensional stress and strain distribution within the SCB tissue helps to understand the mechanism of SCB failure, and may lead to an improved understanding of mechanisms of PTOA initiation, prevention and treatment. In this study, we used high-resolution micro-computed tomography (ÂµCT)-based finite element (FE) modelling of cartilage-bone to evaluate the failure mechanism and the locations of SCB tissue at high-risk of initial failure under compression. The ÂµCT images of five cartilage-bone specimens with an average SCB thickness of 1.23Â±0.20mm were used to develop five ÂµCT-based FE models. The FE models were analysed under axial compressions of approximately 30MPa applied to the cartilage surface while the bone edges were constrained. Strain and stress-based failure criteria were then applied to evaluate the failure mechanism of the SCB tissue under excessive compression through articular cartilage. ÂµCT-based FE models predicted two locations in the SCB at high-risk of initial failure: (1) the interface of the calcified - uncalcified cartilage due to excessive tension, and (2) the trabecular bone beneath the subchondral plate due to excessive compression. ÂµCT-based FE models of cartilage-bone enabled us to quantify the distribution of the applied compression which was transferred through the articular cartilage to its underlying SCB, and to investigate the mechanism and the mode of SCB tissue failure. Ultimately, the results will help to understand the mechanism of injury formation in relation to PTOA.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Novel biomarkers for patients with idiopathic acute anterior uveitis: neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio To assess the levels of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N / L) and the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (P / L) in patients with idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and to compare with healthy controls. Thirty-six male patients with idiopathic AAU and 36 male healthy subjects were enrolled in this retrospective study. Complete ophthalmological examination and complete blood count measurements results of all subjects were evaluated. There was a significant difference in N / L and P / L between idiopathic AAU and control groups (P=0.006, P=0.022). Also, correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and N / L (P=0.002; r=0.461). Our study for the first time provides evidence of N / L and P / L may be useful biomarkers in patients with idiopathic AAU.

"Request and fulfillment of postpartum tubal ligation in patients after high-risk pregnancy Female sterilization is one of the most prevalent methods of contraception in the United States. Prior studies have shown that nearly half of postpartum tubal ligation (PPTL) requests go unfulfilled. This study seeks to establish whether obstetric or medical risk status influences patients ' request for or subsequent completion of PPTL. This study was a retrospective cohort study of women delivering at a university hospital in 2009-2010 who received prenatal care in the faculty and resident clinics. High-risk status was defined by Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine guidelines. Documentation of contraceptive plan and administration of contraceptive methods was abstracted from patient records. Subsequent pregnancies through March 1, 2013, were abstracted. Of 3063 participants (2048 low risk and 1015 high risk), 231 requested PPTL (7.5%). This was more likely among high-risk patients than low-risk patients (10.0% vs. 6.3%, p<.001), those with public insurance (13.8% vs. 3.2%, p<.001) and those with an unintended index pregnancy (13.8% vs. 4.1%, p<.001). Of the patients requesting PPTL, 118 (51.1%) underwent the procedure immediately postpartum. Completion was not associated with high-risk status (54.0%), or with race, insurance status or parity. Among 113 women with an unfulfilled PPTL request, there were 17 subsequent pregnancies (15.0%) during the 27 months of follow-up. Though women with high-risk pregnancies were more likely to request PPTL, they were not more likely to complete the procedure. Over one third of high-risk patients ' requests were unfulfilled, indicating that significant barriers may remain. Though women with high-risk pregnancies were more likely to request PPTL, they were not more likely to complete the procedure. Providers should consider these procedures urgent, especially in high-risk women, and advocate for their patients ' access to this procedure.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Effect of organic and inorganic selenium supplementation on semen quality and blood enzymes in buffalo bulls The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of organic and inorganic selenium (Se) supplementation on semen quality and blood serum profiles of buffalo bulls. Nine mature buffalo bulls were divided into three groups: control (non-supplemented); organic Se (10 mg Sel-Plex Â®/head twice weekly) and inorganic Se (10 mg sodium selenite /head twice weekly). Semen was collected twice a week for 3 months during Se supplementation. Semen properties were evaluated from fresh ejaculate. Moreover, fructose concentration, aspartate and alanine transaminase (AST and ALT) activities, total protein and total cholesterol were assayed in seminal plasma. Additionally AST, ALT, testosterone and Se levels were determined in the blood serum. Results showed that Se supplementation significantly (P < 0.05) influences the semen parameters during 3 months of treatment. Organic Se significantly (P < 0.05) increased the percentage of viable sperms compared to inorganic Se and the control group. Fructose concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the seminal plasma of organic Se - treated bulls. Serum testosterone and Se concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in the Se supplemented groups than the control group. In conclusion, Se supplementation improved the parameters of buffalo bull semen and more precisely, organic Se was more effective for the improvement of semen quality and some blood components than inorganic Se.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Relationship between interpersonal trauma exposure and addictive behaviors: a systematic review The aim of this study was to systematically summarize knowledge on the association between exposure to interpersonal trauma and addictive behaviors. Extant reviews on this association focused on a restricted range of substance-related addictions, and/or used a narrative instead of a systematic approach. Systematic searches of 8 databases yielded 29,841 studies, of which 3054 studies were included and subsequently classified in relation to study design (scoping review). A subset of observational studies (N = 181) prospectively investigating the relationship between exposure to interpersonal traumata and subsequent behavioral or substance-related addiction problems were characterized. Heterogeneity in study methodologies and types of addictive behaviors and traumatic experiences assessed precluded meta-analysis. Instead, the proportions of associations tested in this literature that revealed positive, negative, or null relationships between trauma exposure and subsequent addictive behaviors were recorded, along with other methodological features. Of 3054 included studies, 70.7% (n = 2160) used a cross-sectional design. In the 181 prospective observational studies (407,041 participants, 98.8% recruited from developed countries), 35.1% of the tested associations between trauma exposure and later addictive behaviors was positive, 1.3% was negative, and 63.6% was non-significant. These results were primarily obtained among non-treatment seeking samples (80.7% of studies; n = 146), using single and multi-item measures of addictive behaviors of unknown psychometric quality (46.4% of studies). Positive associations were more frequently observed in studies examining childhood versus adult traumatization (39.7% vs. 29.7%). Longitudinal research in this area emphasizes alcohol abuse, and almost no research has examined behavioral addictions. Results provide some support for a positive association between exposure to interpersonal trauma and subsequent addictive behaviors but this relationship was not consistently reported.

Here, a collection of M. tuberculosis Beijing family isolates from different provinces across all China was genotyped by high-resolution (24-MIRU-VNTR) and low-resolution, high-rank (modern and ancient sublineages) markers. The molecular profiles and global and local phylogenies were compared to the strain phenotype and patient data. The phylogeographic patterns observed in the studied collection demonstrate that large-scale (but not middle/small-scale) distance remains one of the decisive factors of the genetic divergence of M. tuberculosis populations. Analysis of diversity and network topology of the local collections appears to corroborate a recent intriguing hypothesis about Beijing genotype originating in South China. Placing our results within the Eurasian context suggested that important Russian B0/W148 and Asian / Russian A0/94-32 epidemic clones of the Beijing genotype could trace their origins to the northeastern and northwestern regions of China, respectively. The higher clustering of the modern isolates in children and lack of increased MDR rate in any sublineage suggest that not association with drug resistance but other (e.g., speculatively, virulence -related) properties underlie an enhanced dissemination of the evolutionarily recent, modern sublineage of the Beijing genotype in China.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Temporal Trends in Sudden Cardiac Death From 1997 to 2010: A Data Linkage Study Community-wide trends data for sudden cardiac death (SCD) are scarce, unlike widely reported declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Using administrative data, we aimed to examine population-level trends in SCD, stratified by sex, age and prior CVD hospitalisation. Person-linked mortality and hospital morbidity data were used to identify SCD and determine hospitalisation and comorbidity using a 10-year hospitalisation lookback period. Log-linear Poisson regression was used to calculate annual rate changes and rate ratios. In Western Australia, 7160 SCD cases were identified from 1997 to 2010 with males comprising 69%. Overall age-standardised SCD rates decreased by 17% in men and 31% in women from 1997-2001 to 2007-2010. The annual rate reduction was higher in women than men (-4.0%/year versus -2.3%/year; p=0.0039). Significant reductions were observed for 55-69 year-old and 70-84 year-old men and women but not for the 35-54 year-olds. The overall relative risk comparing men to women increased slightly from 2.4 in 1997 to 3.0 in 2010 (trend p=0.0039) but differed across age groups. The relative risk declined in 35-54 year-olds from 5.1 to 3.2 whereas it increased from 2.9 to 3.9 in 55-69 year-olds and 1.9 to 2.3 in 70-84 year-olds. Declining trends in SCD rates were observed in those with and without prior CVD and were similar to CVD mortality trends (-4.9%/year in men and -5.5%/year in women). Trends in rates of SCD fell in middle to older aged men and women, with and without CVD, and mirrored the fall in fatal CVD. Limited improvement in 35-54 year-olds requires further investigation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Can mean platelet volume be used as a biomarker for asthma? Platelets play important roles in airway inflammation and are activated in inflammatory lung diseases, including asthma. We evaluated the mean platelet volume (MPV), used as a marker of platelet activation, in asthmatic patients during asymptomatic periods and exacerbations compared to healthy controls to determine whether MPV can be used as an indicator of inflammation. Our patient group consisted of 95 children with exacerbation of asthma who were admitted to our allergy clinic. The control group consisted of 100 healthy children matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. Mean platelet volume values of the patient group obtained during exacerbation of asthma were compared to those of the same group during the asymptomatic period and with the control group. We investigated factors that can affect the MPV values of asthma patients, including infection, atopy, immunotherapy treatment, and severity of asthma exacerbation. The patient group consisted of 50 (52.6%) boys and 45 (47.4%) girls with a mean age of 125 Â±38 months old. Mean MPV values in the exacerbation period, the healthy period, and in the control group were 8.1 Â±0.8 fl, 8.1 Â±1.06 fl, and 8.2 Â±0.9 fl, respectively; there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05). The severity of asthma, severity of asthma exacerbation, immunotherapy, coinfection, eosinophil count, and IgE level also had no effect on MPV (p > 0.05). Although platelets play a role in the pathophysiology of asthma, MPV measurement is insufficient to detect inflammation through platelets.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"CD169 identifies an activated CD8(+) T cell subset in regional lymph nodes that predicts favorable prognosis in colorectal cancer patients CD169 was first identified on macrophages (MÏ) and linked to antigen presentation. Here, we showed CD169 expression on some CD8(+) T lymphocytes in regional lymph nodes (LNs) and investigated the function and clinical relevance of CD169(+)CD8(+) T cells in tumor-draining LNs of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Fresh tumor-draining LN tissues from 39 randomly enrolled patients were assessed by flow cytometry for activation and differentiation of CD169(+)CD8(+) T cells and T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. In total, 114 tumor-draining LN paraffin sections from CRC patients were analyzed by multiple-color immunofluorescence for CD169(+)CD8(+) T cell distribution and clinical values. The prognostic significance of CD169(+)CD8(+) T cells was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. A fraction of CD8(+) T cells in regional LNs, but not peripheral blood, tonsils, or tumors, expressed surface CD169. In situ detection of draining LNs revealed preferential localization of CD169(+)CD8(+) T cells to subcapsular sinus and interfollicular regions, closely associated with CD169(+) MÏ. CD169(+)CD8(+) T cell ratios were significantly lower in peri-tumor LNs than distant-tumor LNs. CD169(+)CD8(+) T cells predominantly expressed activation markers (CD69, HLA-DR, PD-1) with slightly lower CD45RA and CD62L levels. They produced high granzyme B, perforin, TNF-Î±, and IFNÎ³ levels, and promoted tumor-killing efficiency ex vitro. Moreover, CD169(+)CD8(+) T cells infiltrating tumor-draining LNs decreased with disease progression and were strongly associated with CRC patient survival. We identified novel activated / cytolytic CD169(+)CD8(+) T cells selectively present in regional LNs, potentially serving as a powerful prognostic factor and indicator for selecting patients for immunotherapy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Gleason grade grouping of prostate cancer is of prognostic value in Asian men The International Society of Urological Pathology made recommendations for the use of Grade Groups (GG) originally described by Epstein and colleagues over Gleason score (GS) alone in 2014, which was subsequently adopted by the WHO classification in 2016. The majority of studies validating this revision have been in Caucasian populations. We therefore asked whether the new GG system was retrospectively associated with biochemical disease-free survival in a mixed-ethnicity cohort of Asian men. A total of 680 radical prostatectomies (RPs) from 2005 to 2014 were included. GS from initial biopsy and RP were compared and used to allocate cases to GG, defined as: 1 (GS â¤6); 2 (GS 3+4=7); 3 (GS 4+3=7); 4 (GS 4+4=8/5+3=8/3+5=8) and 5 (GS 9-10). Biochemical recurrence was defined as two consecutive post- RP prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of >0.2 ng/mL after post- RP PSA reaching the nadir of <0.1 ng/mL. Our data showed that Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in biochemical recurrence within Gleason GG based on either biopsy or prostatectomy scoring. Multivariate analysis further confirmed that a higher GG was significantly associated with risk of biochemical recurrence. This GG system had a higher prognostic discrimination for both initial biopsy and RP than GS. Our study validates the use of the revised and updated GG system in a mixed-ethnicity population of Asian men. Higher GG was significantly associated with increased risk of biochemical recurrence. We therefore recommend its use to inform clinical management for patients with prostate cancer.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Prevalence of Psychoactive Substance Consumption in People With Obesity The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the kind of psychoactive substances consumed by people with obesity. Patients were included at their first visit for bariatric surgery. Socio-demographic characteristics, anxiety, depressive disorders and psychoactive substance consumption were assessed. The prevalence of psychoactive substance consumption was compared to that of the general population reported by the French National Institute of Prevention and Health Education. One hundred (100) patients were consecutively recruited: 60 women (mean age 41 Â± 14 years) and 40 men (mean age 46 Â± 13 years). Sixty-seven percent of subjects consumed alcohol. Consumption rates of cannabis (21% vs. 10%), cocaine (7.0% vs. 0.8%) and amphetamine (6.0% vs. 0.3%) were significantly (p < .0001) higher in people with obesity than in the general population. People with obesity have an excess risk of amphetamine, cocaine and cannabis consumption. This consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular and psychiatric morbidity and should therefore be detected before surgery.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"N-linked glycosylation of SV2 is required for binding and uptake of botulinum neurotoxin A Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A1 (BoNT/A1), a licensed drug widely used for medical and cosmetic applications, exerts its action by invading motoneurons. Here we report a 2.0-Ã-resolution crystal structure of the BoNT/A1 receptor - binding domain in complex with its neuronal receptor, glycosylated human SV2C. We found that the neuronal tropism of BoNT/A1 requires recognition of both the peptide moiety and an N-linked glycan on SV2. This N-glycan -which is conserved in all SV2 isoforms across vertebrates -is essential for BoNT/A1 binding to neurons and for its potent neurotoxicity. The glycan - binding interface on SV2 is targeted by a human BoNT/A1 - neutralizing antibody currently licensed as an antibotulism drug. Our studies reveal a new paradigm of host-pathogen interactions, in which pathogens exploit conserved host post-translational modifications, thereby achieving highly specific receptor binding while also tolerating genetic changes across multiple isoforms of receptors.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Altered natal dispersal at the range periphery: The role of behavior, resources, and maternal condition Natal dispersal outcomes are an interplay between environmental conditions and individual phenotypes. Peripheral, isolated populations may experience altered environmental conditions and natal dispersal patterns that differ from populations in contiguous landscapes. We document nonphilopatric, sex -biased natal dispersal in an endangered small mammal, the Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis), restricted to a single mountain. Other North American red squirrel populations are shown to have sex - unbiased, philopatric natal dispersal. We ask what environmental and intrinsic factors may be driving this atypical natal dispersal pattern. We test for the influence of proximate factors and ultimate drivers of natal dispersal: habitat fragmentation, local population density, individual behavior traits, inbreeding avoidance, competition for mates, and competition for resources, allowing us to better understand altered natal dispersal patterns at the periphery of a species' range. A juvenile squirrel's body condition and its mother's mass in spring (a reflection of her intrinsic quality and territory quality) contribute to individual behavioral tendencies for movement and exploration. Resources, behavior, and body condition have the strongest influence on natal dispersal distance, but affect males and females differently. Male natal dispersal distance is positively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and individual tendency for movement; female natal dispersal distance is negatively influenced by its mother's spring body mass and positively influenced by individual tendency for movement. An apparent feedback between environmental variables and subsequent juvenile behavioral state contributes to an altered natal dispersal pattern in a peripheral population, highlighting the importance of studying ecological processes at the both range center and periphery of species' distributions.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The bachelorette: Female Siamese fighting fish avoid males exposed to an estrogen mimic Due to improper disposal and a lack of removal during the wastewater treatment process, endocrine disrupting chemicals enter aquatic ecosystems where they exert detrimental effects on fish behavior and physiology. Perhaps the most well-studied and prevalent EDC is 17Î±-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active ingredient in oral contraceptives, which is known to cause dramatic reductions in male -typical behaviors. While it is likely that alterations in male courtship behavior decrease reproductive fitness, this is rarely explicitly examined. To this end, whether EE2 exposure reduces male attractiveness to female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, was investigated by showing females video images of exposed and unexposed males. Females were randomly assigned to one of two exposure conditions (exposed to EE2, control) and each subject then viewed four different video combinations of male conspecifics (courting exposed + exposed; courting unexposed + unexposed; courting unexposed + exposed; swimming unexposed + exposed). Females, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to EE2, directed markedly less behavior towards exposed males, especially when they viewed an exposed male and an unexposed male simultaneously. These findings demonstrate that EE2 can have significant individual - and population-level consequences on fitness by disrupting sexual selection and, ultimately, the success of exposed males.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Diagnosing neonatal transphyseal fractures of the distal humerus A traumatic birth can cause significant upper limb injury; the presenting features are non-specific and the differential diagnosis long. Transphyseal fractures of the distal humerus are a rare but clinically important birth injury. This injury has typical radiographic findings, which due to the un-ossified nature of the distal humeral epiphysis can easily be misinterpreted. This article presents the radiographic appearance correlated with arthrography, ultrasound and MRI obtained from four cases of neonatal transphyseal fracture of the distal humerus. We hope that by demonstrating the appearances for each of these imaging techniques in relation to the underlying pathology will reduce errors of interpretation that may lead to inappropriate diagnosis and management of these children.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Return to play after hamstring injuries in football (soccer): a worldwide Delphi procedure regarding definition, medical criteria and decision-making There are three major questions about return to play (RTP) after hamstring injuries: How should RTP be defined? Which medical criteria should support the RTP decision? And who should make the RTP decision? The study aimed to provide a clear RTP definition and medical criteria for RTP and to clarify RTP consultation and responsibilities after hamstring injury. The study used the Delphi procedure. The results of a systematic review were used as a starting point for the Delphi procedure. Fifty-eight experts in the field of hamstring injury management selected by 28 FIFA Medical Centres of Excellence worldwide participated. Each Delphi round consisted of a questionnaire, an analysis and an anonymised feedback report. After four Delphi rounds, with more than 83% response for each round, consensus was achieved that RTP should be defined as 'the moment a player has received criteria-based medical clearance and is mentally ready for full availability for match selection and/or full training'. The experts reached consensus on the following criteria to support the RTP decision: medical staff clearance, absence of pain on palpation, absence of pain during strength and flexibility testing, absence of pain during/after functional testing, similar hamstring flexibility, performance on field testing, and psychological readiness. It was also agreed that RTP decisions should be based on shared decision-making, primarily via consultation with the athlete, sports physician, physiotherapist, fitness trainer and team coach. The consensus regarding aspects of RTP should provide clarity and facilitate the assessment of when RTP is appropriate after hamstring injury, so as to avoid or reduce the risk of injury recurrence because of a premature RTP.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Computer-aided Dereplication and Structure Elucidation of Natural Products at the University of Reims Natural product chemistry began in Reims, France, in a pharmacognosy research laboratory whose main emphasis was the isolation and identification of bioactive molecules, following the guidelines of chemotaxonomy. The structure elucidation of new compounds of steadily increasing complexity favored the emergence of methodological work in nuclear magnetic resonance. As a result, our group was the first to report the use of proton-detected heteronuclear chemical shift correlation spectra for the computer-assisted structure elucidation of small organic molecules driven by atom proximity relationships and without relying on databases. The early detection of known compounds appeared as a necessity in order to deal more efficiently with complex plant extracts. This goal was reached by an original combination of mixture fractionation by centrifugal partition chromatography, analysis by (13) C NMR, digital data reduction and alignment, hierarchical data clustering, and computer database search.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Metatranscriptomics Reveals the Active Bacterial and Eukaryotic Fibrolytic Communities in the Rumen of Dairy Cow Fed a Mixed Diet Ruminants have a unique ability to derive energy from the degradation of plant polysaccharides through the activity of the rumen microbiota. Although this process is well studied in vitro, knowledge gaps remain regarding the relative contribution of the microbiota members and enzymes in vivo. The present study used RNA-sequencing to reveal both the expression of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) by the rumen microbiota of a lactating dairy cow and the microorganisms forming the fiber -degrading community. Functional analysis identified 12,237 CAZymes, accounting for 1% of the transcripts. The CAZyme profile was dominated by families GH94 (cellobiose-phosphorylase), GH13 (amylase), GH43 and GH10 (hemicellulases), GH9 and GH48 (cellulases), PL11 (pectinase) as well as GH2 and GH3 (oligosaccharidases). Our data support the pivotal role of the most characterized fibrolytic bacteria (Prevotella, Ruminocccus and Fibrobacter), and highlight a substantial, although most probably underestimated, contribution of fungi and ciliate protozoa to polysaccharide degradation. Particularly these results may motivate further exploration of the role and the functions of protozoa in the rumen. Moreover, an important part of the fibrolytic bacterial community remains to be characterized since one third of the CAZyme transcripts originated from distantly related strains. These findings are used to highlight limitations of current metatranscriptomics approaches to understand the functional rumen microbial community and opportunities to circumvent them.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Generalized Weakness in a Transplant Patient: A Case Presentation Generalized weakness in transplant patients is a major complaint in tertiary rehabilitation hospitals. The diagnosis and management of generalized weakness in this population pose challenges for physicians. We present the case of a transplant patient with generalized weakness who was eventually diagnosed with calciphylaxis using a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach of electrodiagnostics, vascular study, and skin biopsy. Calciphylaxis is a rare cutaneous disorder that mimics other collagen vascular diseases in its presentation and fulminant course. Physiatrists should be cognizant of calciphylaxis, as it signals a poor prognosis if not correctly diagnosed and treated in a timely manner, with high incidence of sepsis, wound pain, and disability.

"Albumin -Bioinspired Gd: CuS Nanotheranostic Agent for In Vivo Photoacoustic / Magnetic Resonance Imaging -Guided Tumor -Targeted Photothermal Therapy Photothermal therapy (PTT) is attracting increasing interest and becoming more widely used for skin cancer therapy in the clinic, as a result of its noninvasiveness and low systemic adverse effects. However, there is an urgent need to develop biocompatible PTT agents, which enable accurate imaging, monitoring, and diagnosis. Herein, a biocompatible Gd -integrated CuS nanotheranostic agent (Gd: CuS @ BSA) was synthesized via a facile and environmentally friendly biomimetic strategy, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a biotemplate at physiological temperature. The as-prepared Gd: CuS @ BSA nanoparticles (NPs) with ultrasmall sizes (ca. 9 nm) exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency and good photostability under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. With doped Gd species and strong tunable NIR absorbance, Gd: CuS @ BSA NPs demonstrate prominent tumor-contrasted imaging performance both on the photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The subsequent Gd: CuS @ BSA -mediated PTT result shows high therapy efficacy as a result of their potent NIR absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency. The immune response triggered by Gd: CuS @ BSA -mediated PTT is preliminarily explored. In addition, toxicity studies in vitro and in vivo verify that Gd: CuS @ BSA NPs qualify as biocompatible agents. A biodistribution study demonstrated that the NPs can undergo hepatic clearance from the body.

"EBV MicroRNA BART16 Suppresses Type I IFN Signaling Type I IFNs play critical roles in orchestrating the antiviral defense by inducing direct antiviral activities and shaping the adaptive immune response. Viruses have evolved numerous strategies to specifically interfere with IFN production or its downstream mediators, thereby allowing successful infection of the host to occur. The prototypic human gammaherpesvirus EBV, which is associated with infectious mononucleosis and malignant tumors, harbors many immune-evasion proteins that manipulate the adaptive and innate immune systems. In addition to proteins, the virus encodes >40 mature microRNAs for which the functions remain largely unknown. In this article, we identify EBV - encoded miR-BART16 as a novel viral immune-evasion factor that interferes with the type I IFN signaling pathway. miR-BART16 directly targets CREB-binding protein, a key transcriptional coactivator in IFN signaling, thereby inducing CREB-binding protein downregulation in EBV-transformed B cells and gastric carcinoma cells. miR-BART16 abrogates the production of IFN - stimulated genes in response to IFN-Î± stimulation and it inhibits the antiproliferative effect of IFN-Î± on latently infected BL cells. By obstructing the type I IFN - induced antiviral response, miR-BART16 provides a means to facilitate the establishment of latent EBV infection and enhance viral replication.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Snack intake is reduced using an implicit, high-level construal cue Priming a high level construal has been shown to enhance self-control and reduce preference for indulgent food. Subtle visual cues have been shown to enhance the effects of a priming procedure. The current study therefore examined the combined impact of construal level and a visual cue reminder on the consumption of energy-dense snack s. A student and community-based adult sample with a wide age and body mass index (BMI) range (N = 176) were randomly assigned to a high or low construal condition in which a novel symbol was embedded. Afterward participants completed a taste test of ad libitum snack foods in the presence or absence of the symbol. The high (vs. the low) construal level prime successfully generated more abstract responses (p < .0001) and reduced intake when the cue - reminder was present (p = .02) but not when it was absent (p = .40). Priming high construal level thinking reduces consumption of high energy dense snacks in the presence of a visual cue - reminder. This may be a practical technique for reducing overeating and has the potential to be extended to other unhealthy behaviors.

"Predictive Factors for Long-term Outcome of Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease Despite the recognition of the usefulness of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN - DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), preoperative predictive factors for the long-term outcome of STN - DBS are not sufficiently established. We performed this study to determine such predictive factors. The subjects were 66 patients who were classified into two groups on the basis of their activities of daily living (ADL) evaluated five years after the STN - DBS surgery: 33 patients were assigned to the independent ADL group (group I) and the remaining 33 patients to the dependent ADL group (group D). Group I patients showed a Schwab and England (S&E) scale score of more than 70 during the off-period, indicating that these patients can maintain their independent ADL all the time. Group D patients showed a score of 70 or lower during the off-period, indicating that these patients cannot maintain their independent ADL for an entire day. We studied the differences in the preoperative state between these two groups. Statistically significant differences were noted in PD onset age, age at surgery, preoperative unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part I score, part II score, total subscore for axial symptoms in part III, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score and S&E score. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the significant independent variables related to long-term independent ADL were the age at surgery, MMSE score and preoperative S&E scale score during the off-period. The PD onset age, age at surgery, preoperative high - level ADL, cognitive function, and axial symptoms are important predictive factors for the long-term outcome of STN - DBS.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The Effect of Sodium Fluoride on Cell Apoptosis and the Mechanism of Human Lung BEAS-2B Cells In Vitro Sodium fluoride (NaF) is a source of fluoride ions used in many applications. Previous studies found that NaF suppressed the proliferation of osteoblast MC3T3 E1 cells and induced the apoptosis of chondrocytes. However, little is known about the effects of NaF on human lung BEAS-2B cells. Therefore, we investigated the mode of cell death induced by NaF and its underlying molecular mechanisms. BEAS-2B cells were treated with NaF at concentrations of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mmol/L. Cell viability decreased and apoptotic cells significantly increased as concentrations of NaF increased over specific periods of time. The IC50 of NaF was 1.9 and 0.9 mM after 24 and 48 h, respectively. The rates of apoptosis increased from 4.8 to 37.7% after NaF exposure. HE staining, electron microscopy, and single cell gel electrophoresis revealed that morphological changes of apoptosis increased with exposure concentrations. RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to detect the apoptotic pathways. The expressions of bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, p53, and the cytoplasmic CytC of the NaF groups increased, while bcl-2 and mitochondrial CytC decreased compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). Further, the fluorescence intensities of ROS in the NaF groups were higher than those in the control group, and the membrane potential of mitochondria in the NaF group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). These findings suggested that NaF induced apoptosis in the BEAS-2B cells through mitochondria -mediated signal pathways. Our study provides the theoretical foundation and experimental basis for exploring the mechanisms of human lung epithelial cell damage and cytotoxicity induced by fluorine.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Catheter traction and gastric outlet obstruction: a repeated complication of using a Foley catheter for gastrostomy tube replacement Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a safe procedure and major morbidity is unusual. However, the number of PEG fed patients is increasing all over the world and complications may become more and more frequent. We describe a 73 years old woman with persistent vomit after replacement of the standard PEG tube with a Foley catheter. An upper GI endoscopy showed the catheter pulled into the duodenum causing gastric outlet obstruction. It was removed and replaced by a suitable standard PEG tube, allowing PEG feeding to be resumed. Previous reports pointed the risk of this complication, almost always associated with insertion of a Foley-type catheter. Replacement of PEG tubes should be performed by experienced teams using standard PEG tubes and the use of Foley-type catheters for this purpose should be banned from routine practice.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Placental Pathologic Associations with Morbidly Adherent Placenta: Potential insights into Pathogenesis The pathology that underlies morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to describe the placental pathology, especially implantation site pathology, associated with MAP. This was a single institution, retrospective case-control study design examining placentas of patients who delivered between January 2008 and September 2013. MAP cases were defined by the need for clinical intervention at delivery beyond spontaneous placental delivery or simple manual extraction of the placenta. Controls consisted of patients with placentas sent for examination due to a history of maternal malignancy with no clinical suspicion of accreta. Placental pathologic findings of maternal vascular underperfusion (MVU), acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, fetal vascular obstruction and hemorrhage were recorded and compared using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Three categories of pathologic changes were seen more commonly in MAP placentas (N=101) than control placentas (N=110): chronic basal inflammation, villous changes of MVU and retromembranous and retromembranous / intervillous hemorrhage. In multivariable analyses adjusted for confounders, chronic basal villitis (aOR 5.6, 1.73-18.18), plasma cell deciduitis (aOR 2.63, 1.08-6.39), increased syncytial knots (aOR 3.92, 1.57-9.75), villous agglutination (aOR 24.85, 2.78-221.75), increased perivillous fibrin (aOR 5.08, 1.49-17.34), and the presence of subchorionic / intervillous thrombi (aOR 4.01, 1.63-9.86) remained associated with MAP. MAP is highly associated with evidence of intraparenchymal placental hemorrhage villous changes of MVU, and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate at the implantation site. The contribution of this basal chronic inflammatory infiltrate to MAP requires further investigation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The Use of a Software - Assisted Method to Estimate Fetal Weight at and Near Term Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging The aim of this study was to apply a semi-automated calculation method of fetal body volume and, thus, of magnetic resonance-estimated fetal weight (MR-EFW) prior to planned delivery and to evaluate whether the technique of measurement could be simplified while remaining accurate. MR-EFW was calculated using a semi-automated method at 38.6 weeks of gestation in 36 patients and compared to the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Per patient, 8 sequences were acquired with a slice thickness of 4-8 mm and an intersection gap of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 mm. The median absolute relative errors for MR-EFW and the time of planimetric measurements were calculated for all 8 sequences and for each method (assisted vs. PACS), and the difference between the methods was calculated. The median delivery weight was 3,280 g. The overall median relative error for all 288 MR-EFW calculations was 2.4% using the semi-automated method and 2.2% for the PACS method. Measurements did not differ between the 8 sequences using the assisted method (p = 0.313) or the PACS (p = 0.118), while the time of planimetric measurement decreased significantly with a larger gap (p < 0.001) and in the assisted method compared to the PACS method (p < 0.01). Our simplified MR-EFW measurement showed a dramatic decrease in time of planimetric measurement without a decrease in the accuracy of weight estimates.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Protocol for intraoperative assessment of the human cerebrovascular glycocalyx Adequate functioning of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is important for brain homoeostasis and normal neuronal function. Disruption of the BBB has been described in several neurological diseases. Recent reports suggest that an increased permeability of the BBB also contributes to increased seizure susceptibility in patients with epilepsy. The endothelial glycocalyx is coating the luminal side of the endothelium and can be considered as the first barrier of the BBB. We hypothesise that an altered glycocalyx thickness plays a role in the aetiology of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common type of epilepsy. Here, we propose a protocol that allows intraoperative assessment of the cerebrovascular glycocalyx thickness in patients with TLE and assess whether its thickness is decreased in patients with TLE when compared with controls. This protocol is designed as a prospective observational case-control study in patients who undergo resective brain surgery as treatment for TLE. Control subjects are patients without a history of epileptic seizures, who undergo a craniotomy or burr hole surgery for other indications. Intraoperative glycocalyx thickness measurements of sublingual, cortical and hippocampal microcirculation are performed by video microscopy using sidestream dark-field imaging. Demographic details, seizure characteristics, epilepsy risk factors, intraoperative haemodynamic parameters and histopathological evaluation are additionally recorded. This protocol has been ethically approved by the local medical ethical committee (ID: NL51594.068.14) and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and principles of Good Clinical Practice. Informed consent is obtained before study enrolment and only coded data will be stored in a secured database, enabling an audit trail.

"Prevalence and Hospital Management of Amphotericin B Deoxycholate -Related Toxicities during Treatment of HIV - Associated Cryptococcal Meningitis in South Africa We aimed to establish the prevalence of amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBd)-related toxicities among South African patients with cryptococcosis and determine adherence to international recommendations to prevent, monitor and manage AmBd -related toxicities. Clinical data were collected from cases of laboratory-confirmed cryptococcosis at 25 hospitals, October 2012 -February 2013. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin (Hb) concentration <10 g/dl, hypokalemia as serum potassium (K) <3.4 mEq/L and nephrotoxicity as an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) to >1.1 times the upper limit of normal. To determine adherence to toxicity prevention recommendations, we documented whether baseline Hb, K and Cr tests were performed, whether pre-emptive hydration and IV potassium chloride (KCl) was administered prior to 80% and 60% of AmBd doses and whether daily oral KCl supplementation was given â¥60% of the time. To determine adherence to monitoring recommendations, we ascertained whether a daily fluid chart was completed, Hb was monitored weekly and K or Cr were monitored bi-weekly. Of 846 patients, clinical data were available for 76% (642/846), 82% (524/642) of whom received AmBd. Sixty-four per cent (n = 333) had documented baseline laboratory tests, 40% (n = 211) were given pre-emptive hydration and 14% (n = 72) and 19% (n = 101) received intravenous and oral KCl. While on AmBd, 88% (n = 452) had fluid monitoring; 27% (n = 142), 45% (n = 235) and 44% (n = 232) had Hb, K and Cr levels monitored. Toxicities developed frequently during treatment: anemia, 16% (86/524); hypokalemia, 43% (226/524) and nephrotoxicity, 32% (169/524). AmBd -related toxicities occurred frequently but were potentially preventable with adequate monitoring, supplemental fluid and electrolyte therapies.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Reduced haemodynamic coupling and exercise are associated with vascular stiffening in pulmonary arterial hypertension Inadequate right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary arterial (PA) functional responses to exercise are important yet poorly understood features of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This study combined invasive catheterisation with echocardiography to assess RV afterload, RV function and ventricular - vascular coupling in subjects with PAH. Twenty-six subjects with PAH were prospectively recruited to undergo right heart catheterisation and Doppler echocardiography at rest and during incremental exercise, and cardiac MRI at rest. Measurements at rest included basic haemodynamics, RV function and coupling efficiency (Î·). Measurements during incremental exercise included pulmonary vascular resistance (Z0), characteristic impedance (ZC, a measure of proximal PA stiffness) and proximal and distal PA compliance (CPA). In patients with PAH, the proximal PAs were significantly stiffer at maximum exercise (ZC =2.31Â±0.38 vs 1.33Â±0.15 WUÃm(2) at rest; p=0.003) and PA compliance was decreased (CPA =0.88Â±0.10 vs 1.32Â±0.17 mL/mm Hg/m(2) at rest; p=0.0002). Z0 did not change with exercise. As a result, the resistance-compliance (RC) time decreased with exercise (0.67Â±0.05 vs 1.00Â±0.07 s at rest; p<10(-6)). When patients were grouped according to resting coupling efficiency, those with poorer Î· exhibited stiffer proximal PAs at rest, a lower maximum exercise level, and more limited CPA reduction at maximum exercise. In PAH, exercise causes proximal and distal PA stiffening, which combined with preserved Z0 results in decreased RC time with exercise. Stiff PAs at rest may also contribute to poor haemodynamic coupling, reflecting reduced pulmonary vascular reserve that contributes to limit the maximum exercise level tolerated.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Progressive Occlusion and Recanalization after Endovascular Treatment for 287 Unruptured Small Aneurysms (<5mm): A Single-Center 6-Year Experience We aimed to investigate the effect of coiling for small unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs)ï¹¤5mm) on progressive occlusio n and recanalization, and the dubious factors related to progressive occlusion and recanalization among UIAs without complete occlusion. A total of 264 patients with 287 small UIAs were coiled in our institute between June 2009 and December 2014. All UIAs enrolled were divided into small (3-5mm) and very small (<3mm) group s, and UIAs without initial complete occlusion were divided into progressive, stable and recanalization groups. Baseline characteristics, procedure -related complications, angiographic follow-up results, and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. Among 287 aneurysms, 211 aneurysms (73.5%) were completely coiled, three (1.2%) intraoperative ruptures and 12 (4.2%) perioperative thromboembolic events occurred. Angiographic follow-up was available for 174 patients (65.9%), the incidence of recanalization was 5.7%. Among 56 aneurysms without complete occlusion, 43 (76.8%) had progressive occlusion and 6(10.7%) had recanalization. Anatomic results of initial and follow-up between small and very small groups were similar in both groups. On logistic regression analysis, smaller size (<3mm) without complete occlusion related to recanalization (OR, 8.0, 95% CI, 1.3-50.0, P=0.026). Our study suggested that coil embolization of small UIAs can achieve a high rate of progressive occlusion and low rate of recanalization during follow-up. Anatomic results of initial and follow-up between small (3-5mm) and very small (<3mm) groups were similar in both groups. What's more, smaller size (<3mm) without complete occlusion may relate to recanalization.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mechanism of motor coordination of masseter and temporalis muscles for increased masticatory efficiency in mice The demand for the use of mice as animal models for elucidating the pathophysiologies and pathogeneses of oral motor disorders has been increasing in recent years, as more and more kinds of genetically modified mice that express functional disorders of the stomatognathic system become available. However, the fundamental characteristics of mouse jaw movements during mastication have yet to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of the masseter and temporalis muscles, and the mechanisms of motor coordination of these muscles for increasing masticatory efficiency in the closing phase in mice. Twenty-two male Jcl: ICR mice were divided into control (n = 8), masseter-hypofunction (n = 7) and temporalis - hypofunction groups (n = 7). Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTâA) was used to induce muscle hypofunction. The masticatory movement path in the horizontal direction during the occlusal phase became unstable after BoNTâA injection into the masseter muscle. BoNTâA injection into the temporalis muscle decreased antero-posterior excursion of the late-closing phase corresponding to the power phase of the chewing cycle. These results suggest that the masseter plays an important role in stabilizing the grinding path, where the food bolus is ground by sliding the posterior teeth from back to front during the occlusal phase. The temporalis plays a major role in retracting the mandible more posteriorly in the early phase of closing, extending the grinding path. Masticatory efficiency is thus increased based on the coordination of activities by the masseter and temporalis muscles.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Field Performance of Transgenic Sugarcane Lines Resistant to Sugarcane Mosaic Virus Sugarcane mosaic disease is mainly caused by the sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV), which can significantly reduce stalk yield and sucrose content of sugarcane in the field. Coat protein mediated protection (CPMP) is an effective strategy to improve virus resistance. A 2-year field study was conducted to compare five independent transgenic sugarcane lines carrying the SCMV-CP gene (i.e., B2, B36, B38, B48, and B51) with the wild-type parental clone Badila (WT). Agronomic performance, resistance to SCMV infection, and transgene stability were evaluated and compared with the wild-type parental clone Badila (WT) at four experimental locations in China across two successive seasons, i.e., plant cane (PC) and 1st ratoon cane (1R). All transgenic lines derived from Badila had significantly greater tons of cane per hectare (TCH) and tons of sucrose per hectare (TSH) as well as lower SCMV disease incidence than those from Badila in the PC and 1R crops. The transgenic line B48 was highly resistant to SCMV with less than 3% incidence of infection. The recovery phenotype of transgenic line B36 was infected soon after virus inoculation, but the subsequent leaves showed no symptoms of infection. Most control plants developed symptoms that persisted and spread throughout the plant with more than 50% incidence. B48 recorded an average of 102.72 t/ha, which was 67.2% more than that for Badila. The expression of the transgene was stable over many generations with vegetative propagation. These results show that SCMV - resistant transgenic lines derived from Badila can provide resistant germplasm for sugarcane breeding and can also be used to study virus resistance mechanisms. This is the first report on the development and field performance of transgenic sugarcane plants that are resistant to SCMV infection in China.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Outcomes of Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma and Bone Metastases in the Targeted Therapy Era Bone metastases (BMs) occur commonly in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved the outcomes for patients with mRCC. However, data on the outcomes of mRCC patients with BMs treated with TKIs are limited. We describe the outcomes of patients with BMs treated with TKI therapy and compare them with the outcomes from a pre-TKI group. Using an institutional tumor registry, a retrospective review of patients with mRCC from 2002 to 2003 and 2006 to 2007 was performed. The baseline characteristics were analyzed, and overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The predictors of OS were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data from 375 patients were reviewed. Of these patients, 188 (50%) started treatment with TKIs and 187 (50%) had started treatment in the pre-TKI era. The distribution of patient characteristics was similar. The sites of organ metastases were equally distributed, including BMs in 48% of the patients in each cohort. The median OS for the patients treated in the TKI era was 22 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-25 months) compared with 14 months (95% CI, 10-19 months; P < .01) for the historical controls. A subset analysis of patients with BM in the TKI era demonstrated a median OS of 24 months (95% CI, 17-28 months) compared with 18 months (95% CI, 10-21 months; P < .01) in pre-TKI era. The predictors of shorter OS were a higher Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center score; liver, lung, and brain metastases; and multiple sites of BMs (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.91; P = .04). The rate of new BM development was the same in the pre- and post- TKI era. The rate of BM development was the same in the pre- and post- TKI era. The management of BMs in patients with mRCC remains challenging.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"20S immunoproteasomes remove formaldehyde - damaged cytoplasmic proteins suppressing caspase-independent cell death Immunoproteasomes are known for their involvement in antigen presentation. However, their broad tissue presence and other evidence are indicative of nonimmune functions. We examined a role for immunoproteasomes in cellular responses to the endogenous and environmental carcinogen formaldehyde (FA) that binds to cytosolic and nuclear proteins producing proteotoxic stress and genotoxic DNA - histone crosslinks. We found that immunoproteasomes were important for suppression of a caspase-independent cell death and the long-term survival of FA-treated cells. All major genotoxic responses to FA, including replication inhibition and activation of the transcription factor p53 and the apical ATM and ATR kinases, were unaffected by immunoproteasome inactivity. Immunoproteasome inhibition enhanced activation of the cytosolic protein damage sensor HSF1, elevated levels of K48-polyubiquitinated cytoplasmic proteins and increased depletion of unconjugated ubiquitin. We further found that FA induced the disassembly of 26S immunoproteasomes, but not standard 26S proteasomes, releasing the 20S catalytic immunoproteasome. FA-treated cells also had higher amounts of small activators PA28Î±Î² and PA28Î³ bound to 20S particles. Our findings highlight the significance of nonnuclear damage in FA injury and reveal a major role for immunoproteasomes in elimination of FA-damaged cytoplasmic proteins through ubiquitin - independent proteolysis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Determinants of On-Road Driving in Multiple Sclerosis To investigate the cognitive, visual, and motor deficits underlying poor performance on different dimensions of on-road driving in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). Prospective cross-sectional study. MS clinic and driving simulator lab. Active drivers (N=102) with various types of MS. Not applicable. Off-road cognitive, visual, and motor functions, as well as 13 specific driving skills. These skills were categorized into hierarchic clusters of operational, tactical, visuo-integrative, and mixed driving. Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the off-road functions influencing performance on the on-road test and each cluster. Visuospatial function (P=.002), inhibition (P=.008), binocular acuity (P=.04), vertical visual field (P=.02), and stereopsis (P=.03) best determined variance in total on-road score (unadjusted R(2)=.37). Attentional shift (P=.0004), stereopsis (P=.007), glare recovery (P=.047), and use of assistive devices (P=.03) best predicted the operational cluster (unadjusted R(2)=.28). Visuospatial function (P=.002), inhibition (P=.002), reasoning (P=.003), binocular acuity (P=.04), and stereopsis (P=.005) best determined the tactical cluster (unadjusted R(2)=.41). The visuo-integrative mode l (unadjusted R(2)=.12) comprised binocular acuity (P=.007) and stereopsis (P=.045). Inhibition (P=.0001) and binocular acuity (P=.001) provided the best model of the mixed cluster (unadjusted R(2)=.25).

"Analysis of a Mouse Skin Model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor gene syndrome in which patients develop several types of tumors, including facial angiofibroma, subungual fibroma, Shagreen patch, angiomyolipomas, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. It is due to inactivating mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. We sought to generate a mouse model of one or more of these tumor types by targeting deletion of the Tsc1 gene to fibroblasts using the Fsp-Cre allele. Mutant, Tsc1ccFsp-Cre+ mice survived a median of nearly a year, and developed tumors in multiple sites but did not develop angiomyolipoma or lymphangioleiomyomatosis. They did develop a prominent skin phenotype with marked thickening of the dermis with accumulation of mast cells, that was minimally responsive to systemic rapamycin therapy, and was quite different from the pathology seen in human TSC skin lesions. Recombination and loss of Tsc1 was demonstrated in skin fibroblasts in vivo and in cultured skin fibroblasts. Loss of Tsc1 in fibroblasts in mice does not lead to a model of angiomyolipoma or lymphangioleiomyomatosis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Relationship between XspI Site Polymorphisms of LDL-R Gene and Serum IL-2 and IL-10 in Patients with Hypercholesterolemia Relationship has been identified in sporadic reports between polymorphisms and hypercholesterolemia. However, the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and polymorphism of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) gene in hypercholesterolemia is unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship and significance between polymorphisms of LDL-R gene and serum Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-10 in patients with hypercholesterolemia. PCR-RFLP and direct DNA sequencing assay were employed to determine polymorphism of LDL-R gene in 900 patients with hypercholesterolemia and 400 healthy cases. ELISA was applied to assay serum concentration of IL-2 and IL-10. Blood lipid indexes were tested in all cases. Compared with the healthy controls, level of IL-2 increased significantly, while IL-10 decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that IL-2 was positively correlated with total cholesterol (TC), LDL-c, and genotype (r = 0.542, 0.410, 0.598, P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with HDL-c (r = -0.352, P < 0.05). Negative relationship also was found between TC, LDL-c, genotype, and IL-10 (r = -0.452, -0.390, -0.613, P < 0.05), and positive correlation between HDL-c and IL-10 (r = 0.398, P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression showed that genotypes and TC were independent factors affecting the levels of IL-2 and IL-10 (P < 0.05). IL-2 and IL-10 were related to gene polymorphisms of LDL-R, which might be involved in the development and progress of hypercholesterolemia.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Caring for relatives with agitation at home: a qualitative study of positive coping strategies Trials of psychological interventions for reducing agitation in people with dementia living at home have been unsuccessful. To inform future interventions by identifying successful strategies of family carers with relatives with dementia and agitation living at home. Qualitative in-depth individual interviews were performed with 18 family carers. We used thematic analysis to identify emerging themes. Carers described initial surprise and then acceptance that agitation is a dementia symptom and learned to respond flexibly. Their strategies encompassed: prevention of agitation by familiar routine; reduction of agitation by addressing underlying causes and using distraction; prevention of escalation by risk enablement, not arguing; and control of their emotional responses by ensuring their relative's safety then walking away, carving out some time for themselves and using family and services for emotional and practical help. These strategies can be manualised and tested in future randomised controlled trials for clinical effectiveness in reducing agitation in people with dementia living at home. None.

"Recombinant MHC Tetramers for Isolation of Virus - Specific CD8(+) Cells from Healthy Donors: Potential Approach for Cell Therapy of Posttransplant Cytomegalovirus Infection Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have a high risk of cytomegalovirus reactivation, which in the absence of T-cell immunity can result in the development of an acute inflammatory reaction and damage of internal organs. Transfusion of the virus-specific donor T-lymphocytes represents an alternative to a highly toxic and often ineffective antiviral therapy. Potentially promising cell therapy approach comprises transfusion of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, specific to the viral antigens, immediately after their isolation from the donor's blood circulation without any in vitro expansion. Specific T-cells could be separated from potentially alloreactive lymphocytes using recombinant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) multimers, carrying synthetic viral peptides. Rapid transfusion of virus - specific T-cells to patients has several crucial advantages in comparison with methods based on the in vitro expansion of the cells. About 30% of hematopoietic stem cell donors and 46% of transplant recipients at the National Research Center for Hematology were carriers of the HLA-A*02 allele. Moreover, 94% of Russian donors have an immune response against the cytomegalovirus (CMV). Using recombinant HLA-A*02 multimers carrying an immunodominant cytomegalovirus peptide (NLV), we have shown that the majority of healthy donors have pronounced T-cell immunity against this antigen, whereas shortly after the transplantation the patients do not have specific T-lymphocytes. The donor cells have the immune phenotype of memory cells and can be activated and proliferate after stimulation with the specific antigen. Donor lymphocytes can be substantially enriched to significant purity by magnetic separation with recombinant MHC multimers and are not activated upon cocultivation with the antigen -presenting cells from HLA - incompatible donors without addition of the specific antigen. This study demonstrated that strong immune response to CMV of healthy donors and prevalence of HLA-A*02 allele in the Russian population make it possible to isolate a significant number of virus-specific cells using HLA-A*02-NLV multimers. After the transfusion, these cells should protect patients from CMV without development of allogeneic immune response.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Association of Hypercalcemia Before Treatment With Hypocalcemia After Treatment in Dogs With Primary Hyperparathyroidism Development of hypocalcemia after treatment of hyperparathyroidism results in increased costs and risk of poorer outcomes. Previous studies have shown conflicting data about predictors of hypocalcemia after these procedures. The objective of this study was to investigate whether ionized calcium (iCa) concentrations before treatment are predictive of hypocalcemia or its clinical signs after surgical removal or heat ablation in dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism. Fifty-four dogs with primary hyperparathyroidism (29 female, 25 male; 49 retrospective, 5 prospective). Dogs were enrolled if they met the inclusion criteria: persistent hypercalcemia (iCa >1.41 mmol/L) due to primary hyperparathyroidism and absence of preemptive calcitriol treatment. All dogs were treated with parathyroidectomy (n = 37) or percutaneous ultrasound-guided heat ablation (n = 17). After treatment, iCa was monitored twice daily until plateau or intervention. There was a moderate correlation between before - treatment hypercalcemia and after-treatment hypocalcemia. The prospective study was terminated due to ethical concerns given findings in the retrospective section. All dogs were placed into groups according to their pretreatment iCa: 1.46-1.61 mmol/L, 1.62-1.71 mmol/L, iCa 1.72-1.81 mmol/L, or >1.81 mmol/L. After treatment, the mean lowest iCa for each group, respectively, was 1.19, 1.18, 1.13, and 1.01 mmol/L. There was a significant association between higher group and proportion of dogs with iCa <1.00 mmol/L (P = .014). This study demonstrates a moderate correlation between iCa concentration before treatment and hypocalcemia after treatment. Dogs with higher initial iCa concentrations should be treated to prevent rapid decline and development of clinical hypocalcemia.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Blood flow in the cerebral venous system: modeling and simulation The development of a software platform incorporating all aspects, from medical imaging data, through three-dimensional reconstruction and suitable meshing, up to simulation of blood flow in patient - specific geometries, is a crucial challenge in biomedical engineering. In the present study, a fully three-dimensional blood flow simulation is carried out through a complete rigid macrovascular circuit, namely the intracranial venous network, instead of a reduced order simulation and partial vascular network. The biomechanical modeling step is carefully analyzed and leads to the description of the flow governed by the dimensionless Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible viscous fluid. The equations are then numerically solved with a free finite element software using five meshes of a realistic geometry obtained from medical images to prove the feasibility of the pipeline. Some features of the intracranial venous circuit in the supine position such as asymmetric behavior in merging regions are discussed.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Pirfenidone normalizes the tumor microenvironment to improve chemotherapy Normalization of the tumor microenvironment by selectively targeting components of the tumor extracellular matrix has been recently proposed to have the potential to decompress tumor blood vessels, increase vessel perfusion and thus, improve drug delivery and the efficacy of cancer therapy. Therefore, we now need to identify safe and well tolerated pharmaceutical agents that are able to remodel the microenvironment of solid tumors and enhance chemotherapy. In this study, we repurposed Pirfenidone, a clinically approved anti-fibrotic drug for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to investigate its possible role on tumor microenvironment normalization. Using two orthotopic mammary tumor models we demonstrate that Pirfenidone reduces collagen and hyaluronan levels and, as a result, significantly increases blood vessel functionality and perfusion and improves the anti-tumor efficacy of doxorubicin. Reduction of extracellular matrix components were mediated via TGFÎ² signaling pathway inhibition due to downregulation of TGFÎ²1, COL1A1, COL3A1, HAS2, HAS3 expression levels. Our findings provide evidence that repurposing Pirfenidone could be used as a promising strategy to enhance drug delivery to solid tumors by normalizing the tumor microenvironment.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Identification of novel macrolides with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and type I and III IFN - augmenting activity in airway epithelium Exacerbations of asthma and COPD are triggered by rhinoviruses. Uncontrolled inflammatory pathways, pathogenic bacterial burden and impaired antiviral immunity are thought to be important factors in disease severity and duration. Macrolides including azithromycin are often used to treat the above diseases, but exhibit variable levels of efficacy. Inhaled corticosteroids are also readily used in treatment, but may lack specificity. Ideally, new treatment alternatives should suppress unwanted inflammation, but spare beneficial antiviral immunity. In the present study, we screened 225 novel macrolides and tested them for enhanced antiviral activity against rhinovirus, as well as anti-inflammatory activity and activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Primary bronchial epithelial cells were grown from 10 asthmatic individuals and the effects of macrolides on rhinovirus replication were also examined. Another 30 structurally similar macrolides were also examined. The oleandomycin derivative Mac5, compared with azithromycin, showed superior induction (up to 5-fold, EC 50 = 5-11 Î¼M) of rhinovirus - induced type I IFNÎ², type III IFNÎ»1 and type III IFNÎ»2/3 mRNA and the IFN - stimulated genes viperin and MxA, yet had no effect on IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA. Mac5 also suppressed rhinovirus replication at 48 h, proving antiviral activity. Mac5 showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae; however, it did not have any antibacterial properties compared with azithromycin when used against Gram-negative Escherichia coli (as a model organism) and also the respiratory pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. Further non-toxic Mac5 derivatives were identified with various anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antibacterial activities. The data support the idea that macrolides have antiviral properties through a mechanism that is yet to be ascertained. We also provide evidence that macrolides can be developed with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antiviral activity and show surprising versatility depending on the clinical need.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"HOST IMMUNE RECOGNITION OF THE EPIDEMIC CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATHOGEN BURKHOLDERIA DOLOSA Burkholderia dolosa caused an outbreak in the cystic fibrosis (CF) clinic at Boston Children's Hospital from 1998 to 2005 and led to the infection of over 40 patients, many of whom died due to complications from infection by this organism. To assess whether B. dolosa significantly contributes to disease or is recognized by the host immune response, mice were infected with a sequenced outbreak B. dolosa strain, AU0158, and responses compared to the well-studied CF pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa In parallel, mice were also infected with a polar flagellin mutant of B. dolosa to examine the role of flagella in B. dolosa lung colonization. The results showed a higher persistence in the host by B. dolosa strains and yet neutrophil recruitment and cytokine production were lower compared to P. aeruginosa The ability of host immune cells to recognize B. dolosa was then assessed and B. dolosa induced a robust cytokine response in cultured cells and this effect was dependent on the flagella only when bacteria were dead. Together, these results suggest that B. dolosa can be recognized by host cells in vitro but may avoid or suppress the host immune response in vivo through unknown mechanisms. B. dolosa was then compared to other Burkholderia species and found to induce similar levels of cytokine production despite being internalized by macrophages more than B. cenocepacia strains. These data suggest that B. dolosa AU0158 may act differently with host cells and is it recognized differently by immune systems compared other Burkholderia strains or species.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors of the Female Genital Tract: A Morphologic, Immunohistochemical, and Molecular Study of 19 Cases Primary primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) of the female genital tract is rare, and its proper classification remains unclear. The clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic features as well as EWSR1 rearrangement status of 19 gynecologic PNETs, including 10 ovarian, 8 uterine, and 1 vulvar tumors, are herein reported. Patient age ranged from 12 to 68 years, with a median age of 20 and 51 years among those with ovarian and uterine PNETs, respectively. Morphologic features of central nervous system (CNS) tumors were seen in 15 PNETs, including 9 medulloblastomas, 3 ependymomas, 2 medulloepitheliomas, and 1 glioblastoma, consistent with central PNET. The remaining 4 PNETs were composed entirely of undifferentiated small round blue cells and were classified as Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET. Eight PNETs were associated with another tumor type, including 5 ovarian mature cystic teratomas, 2 endometrial low-grade endometrioid carcinomas, and a uterine carcinosarcoma. By immunohistochemistry, 17 PNETs expressed at least 1 marker of neuronal differentiation, including synaptophysin, NSE, CD56, S100, and chromogranin in 10, 8, 14, 8, and 1 tumors, respectively. GFAP was positive in 4 PNETs, all of which were of central type. Membranous CD99 and nuclear Fli-1 staining was seen in 10 and 16 tumors, respectively, and concurrent expression of both markers was seen in both central and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET s. All tumors expressed vimentin, whereas keratin cocktail (CAM5.2, AE1/AE3) staining was only focally present in 4 PNETs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was successful in all cases and confirmed EWSR1 rearrangement in 2 of 4 tumors demonstrating morphologic features of Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET and concurrent CD99 and Fli-1 expression. In conclusion, central and Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNETs may be encountered in the female genital tract with central PNETs being more common. Central PNETs show a spectrum of morphologic features that overlaps with CNS tumors but lack EWSR1 rearrangement s. GFAP expression supports a morphologic impression of central PNET and is absent in Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNET. Ewing sarcoma/peripheral PNETs lack morphologic features of CNS tumors.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"High-throughput analysis of sub-visible mAb aggregate particles using automated fluorescence microscopy imaging Aggregation of therapeutic proteins is a major concern as aggregates lower the yield and can impact the efficacy of the drug as well as the patient's safety. It can occur in all production stages; thus, it is essential to perform a detailed analysis for protein aggregates. Several methods such as size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC), light scattering, turbidity, light obscuration, and microscopy-based approaches are used to analyze aggregates. None of these methods allows determination of all types of higher molecular weight (HMW) species due to a limited size range. Furthermore, quantification and specification of different HMW species are often not possible. Moreover, automation is a perspective challenge coming up with automated robotic laboratory systems. Hence, there is a need for a fast, high-throughput-compatible method, which can detect a broad size range and enable quantification and classification. We describe a novel approach for the detection of aggregates in the size range 1 to 1000 Î¼m combining fluorescent dyes for protein aggregate labelling and automated fluorescence microscope imaging (aFMI). After appropriate selection of the dye and method optimization, our method enabled us to detect various types of HMW species of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Using 10 Î¼mol L(-1) 4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonate (Bis-ANS) in combination with aFMI allowed the analysis of mAb aggregates induced by different stresses occurring during downstream processing, storage, and administration. Validation of our results was performed by SE-HPLC, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. With this new approach, we could not only reliably detect different HMW species but also quantify and classify them in an automated approach. Our method achieves high-throughput requirements and the selection of various fluorescent dyes enables a broad range of applications.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Proliferation -Related Activity in Endothelial Cells Is Enhanced by Micropower Plasma Nonthermal plasma has received a lot of attention as a medical treatment technique in recent years. It can easily create various reactive chemical species (ROS) and is harmless to living body. Although plasma at gas - liquid interface has a potential for a biomedical application, the interactions between the gas - liquid plasma and living cells remain unclear. Here, we show characteristics of a micropower plasma with 0.018 W of the power input, generated at gas - liquid interface. We also provide the evidence of plasma -induced enhancement in proliferation activity of endothelial cells. The plasma produced H2O2, HNO2, and HNO3 in phosphate buffered saline containing Mg(++) and Ca(++) (PBS (+)), and their concentration increased linearly during 600-second discharge. The value of pH in PBS (+) against the plasma discharge time was stable at about 7.0. Temperature in PBS (+) rose monotonically, and its rise was up to 0.8Â°C at the bottom of a cell-cultured dish by the plasma discharge for 600 s. Short-time treatment of the plasma enhanced proliferation activity of endothelial cells. In contrast, the treatment of H2O2 does not enhance the cell proliferation. Thus, the ROS production and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) activation due to the plasma treatment might be related to enhancement of the cell proliferation. Our results may potentially provide the basis for developing the biomedical applications using the gas - liquid plasma.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Intra-articular implantation of collagen scaffold carriers is safe in both native and arthrofibrotic rabbit knee joints Sustained intra-articular delivery of pharmacological agents is an attractive modality but requires use of a safe carrier that would not induce cartilage damage or fibrosis. Collagen scaffolds are widely available and could be used intra-articularly, but no investigation has looked at the safety of collagen scaffolds within synovial joints. The aim of this study was to determine the safety of collagen scaffold implantation in a validated in vivo animal model of knee arthrofibrosis. A total of 96 rabbits were randomly and equally assigned to four different groups: arthrotomy alone; arthrotomy and collagen scaffold placement; contracture surgery; and contracture surgery and collagen scaffold placement. Animals were killed in equal numbers at 72 hours, two weeks, eight weeks, and 24 weeks. Joint contracture was measured, and cartilage and synovial samples underwent histological analysis. Animals that underwent arthrotomy had equivalent joint contractures regardless of scaffold implantation (-13.9Â° versus -10.9Â°, equivalence limit 15Â°). Animals that underwent surgery to induce contracture did not demonstrate equivalent joint contracture s with (41.8Â°) or without (53.9Â°) collagen scaffold implantation. Chondral damage occurred in similar rates with (11 of 48) and without (nine of 48) scaffold implantation. No significant difference in synovitis was noted between groups. Absorption of the collagen scaffold occurred within eight weeks in all animals CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that intra-articular implantation of a collagen sponge does not induce synovitis or cartilage damage. Implantation in a native joint does not seem to induce contracture. Implantation of the collagen sponge in a rabbit knee model of contracture may decrease the severity of the contracture .Cite this article: J. A. Walker, T. J. Ewald, E. Lewallen, A. Van Wijnen, A. D.

"The clinicopathological and prognostic features of Chinese and Japanese inpatients with lung cancer Here, we retrospectively compared the differences in clinicopathological behaviors and prognosis of lung cancer from the First Affiliated Hospital (CMU1, n=513), Shengjing Hospital (CMUS, n=1021), Tumor Hospital (CMUT, n=5378) of China Medical University, the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian (DMU, n=2251) and Jinzhou (JMU, n=630) Medical University, Takaoka Kouseiren Hospital (Takaoka, n=163) of Japan. Japanese lung cancer patients showed smaller tumor size, lower TNM staging, lower ratio of squamous cell carcinoma and higher ratio of small and large cell carcinomas than Chinese patients (p<0.05). Survival analysis showed that tumor size was employed as a prognostic factor for the Japanese and Chinese cancer patients (p<0.05). In DMU and CMUS, the ratio s of female patients or adenocarcinoma were higher than other hospitals (p<0.05), while the patients from CMUT and CMU1 were younger than the others (p<0.05). The ratio s of squamous cell carcinoma from CMUT, CMU1 and JMU were higher than the others, while it was the same for the ratio of large and small cell carcinoma in Takaoka and CMU1 (p<0.05). TNM staging was higher in CMUT than JMU and Takaoka (p<0.05). The female patients of lung cancer showed young prone, large tumor size, a high ratio of adenocarcinoma and advanced TNM staging in comparison to the counterpart (p<0.05). The younger patients of lung cancer displayed smaller tumor size, higher ratio of adenocarcinoma, lower TNM staging than the elder in Takaoka (p<0.05). There were more aggressive behaviors and shorter survival time for Chinese than Japanese lung cancer patients. The prevention of lung cancer should be strengthened by establishing a systematic and effective screening strategy, especially for the young and female patients.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Perioperative Management of Severe Hypertension during Laparoscopic Surgery for Pheochromocytoma Phaeochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting vascular tumour that is derived from chromaffin cell. Lethal cardiovascular complications, such as serious hypertension, myocardial infarction and aortic dissection, may occur because of uncontrolled catecholamine release. Each stage of anaesthesia management has vital importance because of this destructive catecholamine secretion that may occur during induction, perioperative stage and surgical manipulation.

"Healthcare usage and economic impact of non-treated obesity in Italy: findings from a retrospective administrative and clinical database analysis Investigate the prevalence of obesity in Italy and examine its resource consumption and economic impact on the Italian national healthcare system (NHS). Retrospective, observational and real-life study. Data from three health units from Northern (Bergamo, Lombardy), Central (Grosseto, Tuscany) and Southern (Naples, Campania) Italy. All patients aged â¥18 years with at least one recorded body mass index (BMI) measurement between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012 were included. Information retrieved from the databases included primary care data, medical prescriptions, specialist consultations and hospital discharge records from 2009-2013. Costs associated with these data were also calculated. Data are presented for two time periods (1 year after BMI measurement and study end). Primary -to estimate health resources consumption and the associated economic impact on the Italian NHS. Secondary -the prevalence and characteristics of subjects by BMI category. 20 159 adult subjects with at least one documented BMI measurement. Subjects with BMI â¥30 kg/m(2) were defined as obese. The prevalence of obesity was 22.2% (N=4471) and increased with age. At the 1-year observation period, obese subjects who did not receive treatment for their obesity experienced longer durations of hospitalisation (median length: 5 days vs 3 days), used more prescription drugs (75.0% vs 57.7%), required more specialised outpatient healthcare (mean number: 5.3 vs 4.4) and were associated with greater costs, primarily owing to prescription drugs and hospital admissions (mean annual cost per year per patient: â¬460.6 vs â¬288.0 for drug prescriptions, â¬422.7 vs â¬ 279.2 for hospitalisations and â¬283.2 vs â¬251.7 for outpatient care), compared with normal weight subjects. Similar findings were observed for the period up to data cut-off (mean follow-up of 2.7 years).

"Association between IL-4 gene polymorphisms, IL-4 serum levels, and ankylosing spondylitis We aimed to investigate the effect of two common polymorphisms in interleukin-4 (IL-4) on serum IL-4 levels and the development of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the Chinese population. A total of 420 inpatients and outpatients diagnosed with AS were enrolled as the case group, and 330 healthy volunteers were selected as the control group. IL-4 rs2243250 and rs2227282 genotype frequencies in the latter were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (both P > 0.05). The TC + TT genotypes and T allele of rs2243250 were strongly associated with elevated AS risk [CC vs TC + TT: odds ratio (OR) = 2.378, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.746-3.239, P < 0.001; C vs T: OR = 2.588, 95% CI = 2.007-3.337, P < 0.001]. Moreover, the rs2227282 GG genotype and G allele may also correlate with increased risk (CC vs GC: OR = 1.555, 95% CI = 1.130-2.141, P = 0.007; CC vs GC + GG: OR = 1.833, 95% CI = 1.357-2.476, P < 0.001; C vs G: OR = 1.403, 95% CI = 1.086-1.811, P = 0.009). In addition, serum IL-4 concentrations were significantly lower in AS patients carrying the rs2243250 TT genotype compared to those with the CC and TC genotypes (both P < 0.05). Similarly, patients carrying the rs2227282 CC genotype demonstrated higher serum IL-4 levels than those with the GC and GG genotypes (both P < 0.05). Our study provides evidence that IL-4 polymorphisms associated with diminished serum IL-4 levels may be partially responsible for AS development in the Chinese population.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Critical role for GLP-1 in symptomatic post-bariatric hypoglycaemia Post-bariatric hypoglycaemia (PBH) is a rare, but severe, metabolic disorder arising months to years after bariatric surgery. It is characterised by symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia, with inappropriately elevated insulin concentrations. The relative contribution of exaggerated incretin hormone signalling to dysregulated insulin secretion and symptomatic hypoglycaemia is a subject of ongoing inquiry. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that PBH and associated symptoms are primarily mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). We conducted a double-blinded crossover study wherein eight participants with confirmed PBH were assigned in random order to intravenous infusion of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1r) antagonist. Exendin (9-39) (Ex-9), or placebo during an OGTT on two separate days at the Stanford University Clinical and Translational Research Unit. Metabolic, symptomatic and pharmacokinetic variables were evaluated. Results were compared with a cohort of BMI - and glucose -matched non-surgical controls (NSCs). Infusion of Ex-9 decreased the time to peak glucose and rate of glucose decline during OGTT, and raised the postprandial nadir by over 70%, normalising it relative to NSCs and preventing hypoglycaemia in all PBH participants. Insulin AUC and secretion rate decreased by 57% and 71% respectively, and peak postprandial insulin was normalised relative to NSCs. Autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms were significantly reduced during Ex-9 infusion. GLP-1r blockade prevented hypoglycaemia in 100% of individuals, normalised beta cell function and reversed neuroglycopenic symptoms, supporting the conclusion that GLP-1 plays a primary role in mediating hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in PBH. Competitive antagonism at the GLP-1r merits consideration as a therapeutic strategy.

"Influence of Plasma Cell Niche Factors on the Recruitment and Maintenance of IRF4hi Plasma Cells and Plasmablasts in Vaccinated, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus - Infected Rhesus Macaques with Low and High Viremia In a recent study, we found that protection following simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) exposure correlated with rectal plasma cell frequency in vaccinated female rhesus macaques. We sought to determine if the same macaques maintained high mucosal plasma cell frequencies postinfection and if this translated to reduced viremia. Although delayed SIV acquisition did not predict subsequent viral control, alterations existed in the distribution of plasma cells and plasmablasts between macaques that exhibited high or low viremia. Flow cytometric analysis of cells from rectal biopsy specimens, bone marrow, and mesenteric lymph nodes of vaccinated infected, unvaccinated infected, and uninfected macaques identified two main IRF4(hi) subsets of interest: CD138 (+) plasma cells, and CD138 (-) plasmablasts. In rectal tissue, plasma cell frequency positively correlated with plasma viremia and unvaccinated macaques had increased plasma cells and plasmablasts compared to vaccinated animals. Likewise, plasmablast frequency in the mesenteric lymph node correlated with viremia. However, in bone marrow, plasmablast frequency negatively correlated with viremia. Accordingly, low-viremic macaques had a higher frequency of both bone marrow IRF4(hi) subsets than did animals with high viremia. Significant reciprocal relationships between rectal and bone marrow plasmablasts suggested that efficient trafficking to the bone marrow as opposed to the rectal mucosa was linked to viral control. mRNA expression analysis of proteins involved in establishment of plasma cell niches in sorted bone marrow and rectal cell populations further supported this model and revealed differential mRNA expression patterns in these tissues. As key antibody producers, plasma cells and plasmablasts are critical components of vaccine -induced immunity to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in humans and SIV in the macaque model; however, few have attempted to examine the role of these cells in viral suppression postinfection. Our results suggest that plasmablast trafficking to and retention in the bone marrow play a previously unappreciated role in viral control and contrast the potential contribution of mucosal plasma cells to mediate protection at sites of infection with that of bone marrow plasmablasts and plasma cells to control viremia during chronic infection. Manipulation of niche factors influencing the distribution and maintenance of these critical antibody-secreting cells may serve as potential therapeutic targets to enhance antiviral responses postvaccination and postinfection.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Cognitive impairment in HIV and HCV co-infected patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis Cognitive impairment has been well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) mono-infections. However, in the context of HIV / HCV co-infection the research is more limited. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the characteristics of cognitive impairment in HIV / HCV co-infection and to examine the differences in cognitive performance between HIV / HCV and HIV and HCV mono-infected patients. Of the 437 records initially screened, 24 papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies indicated that HIV / HCV co-infected patients had a higher level of cognitive impairment than HIV mono-infected patients. Meta-analysis also indicated that HIV mono-infected patients had a significantly lower global deficit score than co-infected patients. The results also indicated that co-infected patients were more likely to be impaired in information processing speed than HIV mono-infected patients. These findings can be challenged by biasing factors such as the small number of included studies, heterogeneity of the samples and a large diversity of methodological procedures. Future research with consistent and comprehensive neuropsychological batteries and covering a greater diversity of risk factors is needed, in order to clarify the effects of both viruses on cognitive function and the mechanisms that underlie these effects. Because cognitive impairments may pose significant challenges to medication adherence, quality of life and overall functioning, such knowledge may have important implications to the planning and implementation of effective interventions aimed at optimising the clinical management of these infections.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"miR-34a Inhibits Lung Fibrosis by Inducing Lung Fibroblast Senescence Cellular senescence has been implicated in diverse pathologies. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the role of this process in tissue fibrosis. Although dysregulation of microRNAs is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis, it is unclear whether microRNAs function by regulating cellular senescence in the disease. In this study, we found that miR-34a demonstrated greater expression in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and in mice with experimental pulmonary fibrosis, with its primary localization in lung fibroblasts. More importantly, miR-34a was up-regulated significantly in both human and mouse lung myofibroblasts. We found that mice with miR-34a ablation developed more severe pulmonary fibrosis than did wild-type animals after fibrotic lung injury. Mechanistically, we found that miR-34a induced a senescent phenotype in lung fibroblasts because this microRNA increased senescence -associated Î²-galactosidase activity, enhanced expression of senescence markers, and decreased cell proliferative capacities. Consistently, we found that primary lung fibroblasts from fibrotic lungs of miR-34a - deficient mice had a diminished senescent phenotype and enhanced resistance to apoptosis as compared with those from wild-type animals. We also identified multiple miR-34a targets that likely mediated its activities in inducing senescence in lung fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data suggest that miR-34a functions through a negative feedback mechanism to restrain fibrotic response in the lungs by promoting senescence of pulmonary fibroblasts.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"ATF3 expression in cardiomyocytes preserves homeostasis in the heart and controls peripheral glucose tolerance Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) trigger a harmful stress - induced cardiac remodeling process known as cardiomyopathy. These diseases represent a serious and widespread health problem in the Western world; however the underlying molecular basis is not clear. ATF3 is an ' immediate early' gene whose expression is highly and transiently induced in response to multiple stressors such as metabolic, oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum and inflammation, stressors that are involved in T2D cardiomyopathy. The role of ATF3 in diabetic cardiomyopathy is currently unknown. Our research has aimed to study the effect of ATF3 expression on cardiomyocytes, heart function and glucose homeostasis in an obesity - induced T2D mouse model. We used wild type mice (WT) as well as mutant mice with a cardiac - specific ATF3 deficiency (ATF3-cKO). Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 15 weeks. HFD induced high ATF3 expression in cardiomyocytes. Mice were examined for cardiac remodeling processes and the diabetic state was assessed. HFD -fed ATF3-cKO mice exhibited severe cardiac fibrosis, higher levels of heart hypertrophic markers, increased inflammation and worse cardiac function, as compared to WT mice. Interestingly, HFD -fed ATF3-cKO mice display increased hyperglycemia and reduced glucose tolerance, despite higher blood insulin levels, as compared to HFD -fed WT mice. Elevated levels of the cardiac inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFÎ± leading to impaired insulin signalling may partially explain the peripheral glucose intolerance. Cardiac ATF3 has a protective role in dampening the HFD - induced cardiac remodeling processes. ATF3 exerts both local and systemic effects related to T2D -induced cardiomyopathy. This study provides a strong relationship between heart remodeling processes and blood glucose homeostasis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A simple and biosafe method for isolation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) are used as an irreplaceable tool for the study of vascular diseases. However, the technicians who isolate HUVECs are largely exposed to potential infectious threats. Here we report the development of a specialized instrument to protect researchers from known or unknown infectious agents when they operate on human umbilical cords. This instrument can be assembled by common laboratory supplies and adapted to accommodate umbilical cords of different lengths. When the cord is enclosed within the instrument, the risk of sample contamination and operator infection is greatly reduced. Using our instrument, endothelial cells were successfully isolated from human umbilical veins without contamination. The cells were verified by their cobblestone-like morphology and by immunofluorescence staining (Factor VIII and CD31 positivity and Î±-SMA negativity). Our instrument simplifies and optimizes the cell extraction process, and most importantly elevates the biosafety to a higher level during the isolation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Rolling out of kangaroo mother care in secondary level facilities in Bihar -Some experiences Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of under-five child deaths worldwide and in India. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a powerful and easy-to-use method to promote health and well-being and reduce morbidity and mortality in preterm / low birth weight (LBW) babies. As the part of the roll-out of India Newborn Action Plan interventions, we implemented KMC in select facilities with an objective to assess the responsiveness of public health system to roll out KMC. KMC intervention was implemented in two select high priority districts, Gaya and Purnea in Bihar over the duration of 8 months from August 2015 to March 2016. The implementation of intervention was phased out into; situation analysis, implementation of intervention, and interim assessment. KMC model, as envisaged keeping in mind the building blocks of health system, was established in 6 identified health-care facilities. A pretested simple checklist was used to assess the awareness, knowledge, skills, and practice of KMC during baseline situational analysis and interim assessment phases for comparison. The intervention clearly seemed to improve the awareness among auxiliary nurse midwives / nurses about KMC. Improvements were also observed in the availability of infrastructure required for KMC and support logistics like facility for manual expression of breast milk, cups /suitable devices such as paladi cups for feeding small babies and digital weighing scale. Although the recording of information regarding LBW babies and KMC practice improved, still there is scope for much improvement. There is a commitment at the national level to promote KMC in every facility. The present experience shows the possibility of rolling out KMC in secondary level facilities with support from government functionaries.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Collecting and Reporting Safety Data and Monitoring Trial Conduct In Pragmatic Trials Pragmatic trials offer the opportunity to obtain real-life data on the relative effectiveness and safety of a treatment before or after market authorisation. This is the penultimate paper in a series of eight, describing the impact of design choices on the practical implementation of pragmatic trials. This paper focuses on the practical challenges of collecting and reporting safety data and of monitoring trial conduct while maintaining routine clinical care practice. Current ICH guidance recommends that, all serious adverse events (SAEs) and all drug -related events must be reported in an interventional trial. In line with current guidance, we propose a risk based approach to the collection of non - drug related non-serious AEs, and even serious events not related to treatment based on the risk profile of the medicine /class in the patient population of interest. Different options available to support the collection and reporting of safety data whilst minimizing study -related follow-up visits are discussed. A risk -based approach to monitoring trial conduct is also discussed, highlighting the difference in the balance of risks likely to occur in a pragmatic trial compared to traditional clinical trials, and the careful consideration that must be given to the mitigation and management of these risks in order to maintain routine care.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Biosynthetic Gene Cluster for Surugamide A Encompasses an Unrelated Decapeptide, Surugamide F Genome mining is a powerful method for finding novel secondary metabolites. In our study on the biosynthetic gene cluster for the cyclic octapeptides surugamides A-E (inhibitors of cathepsin B), we found a putative gene cluster consisting of four successive non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes, surA, surB, surC, and surD. Prediction of amino acid sequence based on the NRPSs and gene inactivation revealed that surugamides A-E are produced by two NRPS genes, surA and surD, which were separated by two NRPS genes, surB and surC. The latter genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of an unrelated peptide, surugamide F. The pattern of intercalation observed in the sur genes is unprecedented. The structure of surugamide F, a linear decapeptide containing one 3-amino-2-methylpropionic acid (AMPA) residue, was determined by spectroscopic methods and was confirmed by solid-phase peptide synthesis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Preparation and evaluation of biopolymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery system in effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis The study purposes to evaluate nanocrystalline biopolymeric nanoparticles encapsulating methotrexate and dexamethasone with high biocompatibility, enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity. Chitosan nanoparticles were prepared by ionic gelation, and Methotrexate (MTX) and Dexamethasone (DEX) were loaded during the preparation and screened for their in vitro efficacy in HEK and RAW264.7 cells, ex vivo and in vivo efficacy. FTIR confirmed the involvement of phosphoric group of sTPP with amine groups of chitosan and also role of hydrogen bonding involved in the preparation of MTXCHNP and DEXCHNP. Controlled release patterns coupled with diffusion of drug were observed in two different buffers (PBS) at pH 7.4 and pH 5.8. The IC50 for MTXCHNP for HEK was 26.1 Î¼g/ml and 7.7 Î¼g/ml for RAW 264.7 cells. In DEXCHNP, the IC50 was 20.12 Î¼g/ml for HEK and 7.37 Î¼g/ml for RAW264.7 cells. Enhanced uptake of FITC - CHNP by RAW cells indicated internalization of nanoparticles by phagocytosis. The enhanced release of drug at lower pH justified increased cytotoxicity. Negligible ex-vivo hemolysis indicated the higher biocompatibility of the nanoparticles. (99m)Tc - CHNP exhibited maximum absorption in blood circulation in 3 h, followed by hepatic metabolism and renal clearance. Higher in-vivo anti-arthritic activity and antioxidant activity was observed post-intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections by both MTXCHNP and DEXCHNP when compared to MTX (0.75 mg/Kg by i.p. route) and DEX (0.2 mg/Kg/ i.p. /daily) per se. The nanocrystalline biopolymeric nanoparticles were stable, biocompatible and have potential to be administered through i.p. route with minimal toxicity and high efficacy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Quantification of leakage of sub-micron aerosols through surgical masks and facemasks for pediatric use Surgical respirators, surgical masks (SMs), and facemasks for pediatric use (FPUs) are routinely used in the U.S. healthcare industry as personal protective equipment (PPE) against infectious diseases. While N95s including surgical respirators have been routinely studied, SMs and FPUs have not received as much attention, particularly in the context of aerosolized threats. This is because SMs and PFUs are not designed to protect against sub-micron aerosols. However, with the possibility of new or re-emerging airborne diseases or bio-aerosol weapons lingering, combined with the limited availability of respirators and logistical issues associated with fit-testing millions, the general adult and pediatric populations may elect to wear SMs and FPUs, respectively, in the case of a pandemic or a bio-terrorist attack. When a person dons a PPE, gaps are created between the wearer's face and the PPE, and aerosols leaking through these gaps can be an important contributor to the risk of infection compared to filtered aerosols. To understand and quantify the contribution of leakage of aerosols through gaps, with particular emphasis on SMs and FPUs, this study investigated leakage of charge-neutralized, polydispersed, dried sodium-chloride aerosols across different brands of PPE. Different breathing rates, aerosol particle sizes, and gap sizes were considered. A few major findings of this study were: (a) leakage, is not a strong function of sub-micron aerosol size; (b) for the same gap size, leakage of aerosols through surgical respirators can often be higher than in SMs and FPUs; and (c) as the gap size increases, the increase in leakage through surgical respirators is higher compared for SMs and FPUs, implying that some SMs and FPUs that possess electret layers may be preferable to N95s that have not been fit-tested. The results obtained can also be used to explain conflicting findings from clinical studies on the effectiveness of SMs when compared to N95s and can be input into risk-assessment models to determine the increase in infection rate resulting from deployment of PPE under less-than-ideal conditions.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Sevoflurane postconditioning improves myocardial mitochondrial respiratory function and reduces myocardial ischemia - reperfusion injury by up-regulating HIF-1 Sevoflurane postconditioning (SPostC) can exert myocardial protective effects similar to ischemic preconditioning. However, the exact myocardial protection mechanism by SPostC is unclear. Studies indicate that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) maintains cellular respiration homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity under hypoxic conditions. This study investigated whether SPostC could regulate the expression of myocardial HIF-1Î± and to improve mitochondrial respiratory function, thereby relieving myocardial ischemia - reperfusion injury in rats. The myocardial ischemia - reperfusion rat model was established using the Langendorff isolated heart perfusion apparatus. Additionally, postconditioning was performed using sevoflurane alone or in combination with the HIF-1Î± inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2). The changes in hemodynamic parameters, HIF-1Î± protein expression levels, mitochondrial respiratory function and enzyme activity, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rates, and mitochondrial ultrastructure were measured or observed. Compared to the ischemia - reperfusion (I / R) group, HIF-1Î± expression in the SPostC group was significantly up-regulated. Additionally, cardiac function indicators, mitochondrial state 3 respiratory rate, respiratory control ratio (RCR), cytochrome C oxidase (CcO), NADH oxidase (NADHO), and succinate oxidase (SUCO) activities, mitochondrial ROS production rate, and mitochondrial ultrastructure were significantly better than those in the I / R group. However, these advantages were completely reversed by the HIF-1Î± specific inhibitor 2ME2 (P<0.05). The myocardial protective function of SPostC might be associated with the improvement of mitochondrial respiratory function after up-regulation of HIF-1Î± expression.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Factor structure of therapist fidelity to individual resiliency training in the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program Evidence-based approaches and early intervention have improved the long-term prognosis of individuals with schizophrenia. However, little is known about the therapeutic processes involved in individual therapy in first-episode psychosis. A comprehensive psychosocial / psychiatric programme for this population, NAVIGATE, includes an individual therapy component, individual resiliency training (IRT). Fidelity of clinicians ' adherence to the IRT protocol has been collected to ensure proper implementation of this manual-based intervention. These data can provide insight into the elements of the therapeutic process in this intervention. To achieve this goal, we first examined the factor structure of the IRT fidelity scale with exploratory factor analysis. Second, we explored the relationships among the IRT fidelity ratings with clinician years of experience and years of education, as well as client's baseline symptom severity and duration of untreated psychosis. Results supported a 2-factor structure of the IRT fidelity scale. Correlations between clinician years of education and fidelity ratings were statistically significant.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Periodontal status of tuberculosis patients - Is there a two-way link? The influence of systemic disorders on periodontal tissues is well established. Amongst various chronic debilitating diseases, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major health problems in most developing countries. Although it has a definite affinity for the lungs, it can affect any part of the body including the oral cavity. TB and periodontitis are the two distinct disease processes. But environmental and biological factors play a key role in etiopathogenesis of both the diseases. These factors alter tissue microenvironment leading to cascade of untoward events. To assess and compare the periodontal status of TB patients with that of non-TB subjects. 50 subjects were recruited and divided into 2 groups. Group A consisted of subjects suffering from TB serving as Test group while group B included non-TB subjects serving as Control group. Unpaired t-test was used. Statistically significant difference in probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing was found between groups A and B, with the difference being higher in group A subjects, thus concluding that periodontal status might be linked with TB.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Recruitment of Minority Adolescents and Young Adults into Randomised Clinical Trials: Testing the Design of the Technology Enhanced Community Health Nursing (TECH-N) Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Trial Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) disproportionately affects adolescent and young adult (AYA) women and can negatively influence reproductive health trajectories. Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have focused on strategies to improve outpatient adherence or to reduce reproductive morbidity in this population. This paper describes the research methods and preliminary effectiveness of recruitment, retention, and intervention strategies employed in a novel RCT designed to test a technology-enhanced community-health nursing (TECH-N) intervention among urban AYA with PID. AYA women aged 13-25 years were recruited during acute PID visits in outpatient clinics and emergency departments (ED) to participate in this IRB-approved trial. Participants completed an audio-computerized self-interview (ACASI), provided vaginal specimens, and were randomized to standard treatment or the intervention. Intervention participants received text-messaging support for 30 days and a community health nurse (CHN) interventionist performed a home visit with clinical assessment within 5 days after enrollment. All patients received a full course of medications and completed research visits at 14- days (adherence), 30 days and 90 days with by an outreach worker. STI testing performed at the 30-and 90- day visits. Exploratory analyses using descriptive statistics were conducted to examine recruitment, retention, and follow-up data to test the overall design of the intervention. In the first 48 months, 64% of 463 patients were eligible for the study and 81.2% of 293 eligible patients were recruited for the study (63.3%); 238 (81.2%) of eligible patients were enrolled. Most participants were African American (95.6%) with a mean age of 18.6 (2.3). Ninety-four percent of individuals assigned to the TECH-N intervention completed the nursing visits. All completed visits have been within the 5- day window and over 90% of patients in both arms have been retained over the 3- month follow-up period. Biological data suggests a shift in the biological milieu with the predominance of Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Trichomonas vaginalis infections. Preliminary data from the TECH-N study demonstrated that urban, low-income, minority AYA with PID can effectively be recruited and retained to participate in sexual and reproductive health RCTs with sufficient investment in the design and infrastructure of the study. Community -based sexual health interventions appear to be both feasible and acceptable in this population.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Dispersal traits may reflect dispersal distances, but dispersers may not connect populations demographically Ecological traits that reflect movement potential are often used as proxies for measured dispersal distances. Whether such traits reflect actual dispersal is often untested. Such tests are important because maximum dispersal distances may not be achieved and many dispersal events may be unsuccessful (without reproduction). For insects, many habitat patches harbour ' resident ' species that are present as larvae (sedentary) and adults (winged and dispersing), and ' itinerant ' species present only as adults that have dispersed from elsewhere and fail to reproduce. We tested whether itinerancy patterns were temporally consistent, and whether itinerant and resident species differed in wing morphology, a strong correlate of flight capability. Over 3 years and at multiple locations in a 22 km stream length, we sampled larvae and adults of caddisflies in the genus Ecnomus to categorize species as residents or itinerants. Flight capacity was measured using wing size (length and area) and shape parameters (aspect ratio and the second moment of wing area). Three species of Ecnomus were residents and three species were itinerants, and patterns were consistent over 3 years. On average, itinerant species had larger wings, suggesting a greater capacity to fly long distances. Wing shape differed between species, but did not differ systematically between residents and itinerants. Wing morphology was associated with actual but not effective dispersal of some species of Ecnomus. Morphological traits may have weak explanatory power for hypotheses regarding the demographic connectedness of populations, unless accompanied by data demonstrating which dispersers contribute new individuals to populations.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Stromal Gli2 activity coordinates a niche signaling program for mammary epithelial stem cells The stem cell niche is a complex local signaling microenvironment that sustains stem cell activity during organ maintenance and regeneration. The mammary gland niche must support its associated stem cells while also responding to systemic hormonal regulation that triggers pubertal changes. We find that Gli2, the major Hedgehog pathway transcriptional effector, acts within mouse mammary stromal cells to direct a hormone-responsive niche signaling program by activating expression of factors that regulate epithelial stem cells as well as receptors for the mammatrophic hormones estrogen and growth hormone. Whereas prior studies implicate stem cell defects in human disease, this work shows that niche dysfunction may also cause disease, with possible relevance for human disorders and in particular the breast growth pathogenesis associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Candida krusei form mycelia along agar surfaces towards each other and other Candida species Candida krusei has been known to exhibit communal interactions such as pellicle formation and crawling out of nutritional broth. We noticed another possible interaction on agar surfaces, where C. krusei yeast cells formed mycelia along agar surfaces toward each other. We report here the results of experiments to study this interaction. When C.krusei yeast cells are plated in parallel streaks, they form mycelia along agar surfaces toward other yeasts. They also detect the presence of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata across agar surfaces, while the latter two react neither to their own kind, nor to C. krusei. Secreted molecule(s) are likely involved as C.krusei does not react to heat killed C. krusei. Timing and rate of mycelia formation across distances suggests that mycelia start forming when a secreted molecule(s) on agar surface reaches a certain concentration. We detected farnesol, tyrosol and tryptophol molecules that may be involved with mycelial formation, on the agar surfaces between yeast streaks. Unexpectedly the amounts detected between streaks were significantly higher than would have expected from additive amounts of two streaks. All three Candida species secreted these molecules. When tested on agar surface however, none of these molecules individually or combined induced mycelia formation by C. krusei. Our data confirms another communal interaction by C. krusei, manifested by formation of mycelia by yeast cells toward their own kind and other yeasts on agar surfaces. We detected secretion of farnesol, tyrosol and tryptophol by C. krusei but none of these molecules induced this activity on agar surface making it unlikely that they are the ones utilized by this yeast for this activity.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Assessing the benefits of targeted drug delivery by nanocarriers: A partico/pharmacokinetic framework An in vivo kinetic framework is introduced to analyze and predict the quantitative advantage of using nanocarriers to deliver drugs, especially anticancer agents, compared to administering the same drugs in their free form. This framework recognizes three levels of kinetics. First is the particokinetics associated with deposition of nanocarriers into tissues associated with drug effect and toxicity, their residence inside those tissues, and elimination of the nanocarriers from the body. Second is the release pattern in time of free drug from the nanocarriers. Third is the pharmacokinetics of free drug, as it relates to deposition and elimination processes in the target and toxicity associated tissues, and total body clearance. A figure of merit, the drug targeting index (DTI), is used to quantitate the benefit of nanocarrier based drug delivery by considering the effects of preferential deposition of nanoparticles into target tissues and relative avoidance of tissues associated with drug toxicity, compared to drug that is administered in its free form. General methods are derived for calculating DTI when appropriate particokinetic, pharmacokinetic, and drug release rate information is available, and it is shown that relatively simple algebraic forms result when some common assumptions are made. This approach may find use in developing and selecting nanocarrier formulations, either for populations or for individuals.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Identification of a group of XTHs genes responding to heavy metal mercury, salinity and drought stresses in Medicago truncatula Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTH) are one of the key enzymes regulating cell wall construction, extension and metabolism. In the study, 44 XTH protein genes from Medicago truncatula genome were identified using bioinformatics, microarray and RT-PCR. Each XTH was showed to possess a highly conserved domain ((D/N)-E-(I/L/F/V)-D-(F/I/L)-E-(F/L)-L-G), and most of XTHs possess four Cys in the C terminal region, which suggests the potential for generating disulfide bonds. Based on the XTH protein sequences, these XTHs can be classified into three major families and each family can be subdivided into more groups. Examination of the genomic location of XTH genes on M. truncatula chromosomes showed that the evolutional expansion of the genes was possibly attributed to localized gene duplications. To investigate the possible involvement of the XTHs responding to heavy metals and other abiotic stresses, the XTH genes were exposed to heavy metal (Hg or Cu), salt and drought stresses. There were 28, 21 and 21 MtXTH genes found to respond to HgCl2, salt and drought stresses, respectively, but their expression were different under the stresses. Some of the XTH genes were well confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We further specified expression of a XTH gene Medtr4g128580 (MtXTH3) under different environmental stresses, and showed that MtXTH3 was induced by Hg exposure. These results indicated that a group of MtXTHs could be differentially expressed under the environmental stresses.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Stressful life events and leucocyte telomere length: Do lifestyle factors, somatic and mental health, or low grade inflammation mediate this relationship? Results from a cohort of Danish men born in 1953 Exposure to psychosocial stress is associated with increased risk of a number of somatic and mental disorders with relation to immune system functioning. We aimed to explore whether stressful events in early and recent life was associated with leucocyte telomere length (TL), which is assumed to reflect the accumulated burden of inflammation and oxidative stress occurring during the life course. We specifically aimed to address whether childhood constitutes a sensitive period and how much of the relation between stressful life events and TL is mediated through somatic and mental health, lifestyle, and markers of low-grade inflammation. A cohort of Danish men born in 1953 has been followed since birth in the Metropolit Cohort. These men underwent a health examination including blood sampling in 2010 and a subset of 324 also had a quantitative PCR-based measurement of TL. The relation between stressful life events and TL was analysed using structural equation modelling, which also provided an estimate of the proportion of the total effect mediated by somatic and mental health (cardiovascular disease, body mass and depressive mood), lifestyle factors, and low grade inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10). Total number of stressful events experienced during the life course was not associated with TL. In terms of sensitive periods, we found that number of stressful events in childhood was associated with shorter TL (Î²per number stressful events in childhood =-0.02(SE=-0.02); P=0.05). This relation was particularly strong for being placed away from home (Î²=-0.16; P<0.000). Thirty percent of the total effect of stressful events in childhood on TL was mediated by the included variables, with the largest proportion being mediated through depressive mood (16%) and CRP (9%). This study suggests that stressful events in childhood are associated with shorter TL in middle-aged men and that part of this relation is explained by depressive mood and low grade inflammation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Ghrelin Protects the Thymic Epithelium From Conditioning-Regimen - Induced Damage and Promotes the Restoration of CD4+ T Cells in Mice After Bone Marrow Transplantation The delay in immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), especially a delay in central immune reconstitution, leads to opportunistic infections and disease relapse after transplantation and affects the long-term outcome of HSCT. This delay is mainly attributable to thymic damage after myeloablative chemotherapy and radiotherapy METHODS: We established a model of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice and administered ghrelin (GRL) 7 days before the conditioning regimen or the day after BMT. All the GRL - treated mice, especially those administered GRL prior to the conditioning regimen, exhibited more intact thymic architecture and a more rapid restoration of CD4 T lymphocytes after BMT than those of the corresponding control mice. Moreover, the levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) were significantly higher in the mice treated with GRL prior to the conditioning regimen than in the control mice at 28 days after BMT. Our finding s suggest that GRL may be a novel potential therapeutic approach to protecting the thymic epithelium from conditioning-regimen - induced damage and promoting rapid and durable thymic and peripheral CD4 T cell recovery after HSCT.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Lower-Limb Muscular Strength, Balance, and Mobility Levels in Adults Following Severe Thermal Burn Injuries Severe burn injuries are associated with hypermetabolic response and increased catabolism. These lead to a vast loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle strength and function. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the impact of severe burn injuries on lower-limb muscular strength, balance, and mobility level in adults. Forty burned adults with burned TBSA (burned TBSA) â¥40% participated in this study. The peak torque and total work of quadriceps and knee flexors were calculated at 150Â°/sec using Biodex isokinetic dynamometer. Balance and mobility were tested via the Biodex balance device and the high mobility assessment tool, respectively. Twenty-three matched nonburned healthy adults were evaluated and served as a control group. Severely burned adults exhibited significantly lower peak torque and total work in their quadriceps (27.50 and 22.58%, P < .05) and knee flexors (23.72, and 21.65%, P < .05) relative to the nonburned adults. Burned adults had a significant decrease in stability index and balance including the dynamic limits of stability (P < .05). The high mobility assessment tool scores were significantly lower (42 Â± 7.64, P < .05) when compared with control subjects (51 Â± 1.62). Patients who had severe burns (burned TBSA â¥ 40%) showed muscular weakness, limited balance, and mobility levels between 16 and 24 weeks after discharge from the hospital compared with matched nonburned control subjects. These results can guide therapists in creating rehabilitation programs that focus on the specific difficulties faced by burned patients.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A Variant in the BACH2 Gene Is Associated With Susceptibility to Autoimmune Addison's Disease in Humans Autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD) is a rare but highly heritable condition. The BACH2 protein plays a crucial role in T lymphocyte maturation, and allelic variation in its gene has been associated with a number of autoimmune conditions. We aimed to determine whether alleles of the rs3757247 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the BACH2 gene are associated with AAD. This case-control association study was performed in two phases using Taqman chemistry. In the first phase, the rs3757247 SNP was genotyped in 358 UK AAD subjects and 166 local control subjects. Genotype data were also available from 5154 healthy UK controls from the Wellcome Trust (WTCCC2) for comparison. In the second phase, the SNP was genotyped in a validation cohort comprising 317 Norwegian AAD subjects and 365 controls. The frequency of the minor T allele was significantly higher in subjects with AAD from the United Kingdom compared to both the local and WTCCC2 control cohorts (58% vs 45 and 48%, respectively) (local controls, P = 1.1 Ã 10(-4); odds ratio [OR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-2.18; WTCCC2 controls, P = 1.4 Ã 10(-6); OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23-1.69). This finding was replicated in the Norwegian validation cohort (P = .0015; OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.14-1.75). Subgroup analysis showed that this association is present in subjects with both isolated AAD (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22-1.92) and autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12-1.69) in the UK cohort, and with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 in the Norwegian cohort (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.22-2.06). We have demonstrated, for the first time, that allelic variability at the BACH2 locus is associated with susceptibility to AAD. Given its association with multiple autoimmune conditions, BACH2 can be considered a ""universal"" autoimmune susceptibility locus.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Inhibitor Selectivity for Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 7: A Structural, Thermodynamic, and Modelling Study Deregulation of the cell cycle by mechanisms that lead to elevated activities of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) is a feature of many human diseases, cancer in particular. We identified small-molecule inhibitors that selectively inhibit CDK7, the kinase that phosphorylates cell-cycle CDKs to promote their activities. To investigate the selectivity of these inhibitors we used a combination of structural, biophysical, and modelling approaches. We determined the crystal structures of the CDK7 -selective compounds ICEC0942 and ICEC0943 bound to CDK2, and used these to build models of inhibitor binding to CDK7. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of inhibitors bound to CDK2 and CDK7 generated possible models of inhibitor binding. To experimentally validate these models, we gathered isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding data for recombinant wild-type and binding site mutants of CDK7 and CDK2. We identified specific residues of CDK7, notably Asp155, that are involved in determining inhibitor selectivity. Our MD simulations also show that the flexibility of the G-rich and activation loops of CDK7 is likely an important determinant of inhibitor specificity similar to CDK2.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Preparing the Health System to Respond to Ebola Virus Disease in New York City, 2014 The world's largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease began in West Africa in 2014. Although few cases were identified in the United States, the possibility of imported cases led US public health systems and health care facilities to focus on preparing the health care system to quickly and safely identify and respond to emerging infectious diseases. In New York City, early, coordinated planning among city and state agencies and the health care delivery system led to a successful response to a single case diagnosed in a returned health care worker. In this article we describe public health and health care system preparedness efforts in New York City to respond to Ebola and conclude that coordinated public health emergency response relies on joint planning and sustained resources for public health emergency response, epidemiology and laboratory capacity, and health care emergency management.

"Obstacle course runs: review of acquired injuries and illnesses at a series of Canadian events (RACE) The growing popularity of obstacle course runs (OCRs) has led to significant concerns regarding their safety. The influx of injuries and illnesses in rural areas where OCRs are often held can impose a large burden on emergency medical services (EMS) and local EDs. Literature concerning the safety of these events is minimal and mostly consists of media reports. We sought to characterise the injury and illness profile of OCRs and the level of medical care required. This study analysed OCR events occurring in eight locations across Canada from May to August 2015 (total 45 285 participants). Data were extracted from event medical charts of patients presenting to the onsite medical team, including injury or illness type, onsite treatment and disposition. There were 557 race participants treated at eight OCR events (1.2% of all participants). There were 609 medical complaints in total. Three quarters of injuries were musculoskeletal in nature. Eighty-nine per cent returned to the event with no need for further medical care. The majority of treatments were completed with first aid and basic medical equipment. Eleven patients (2% of patients) required transfer to hospital by EMS for presentations including fracture, dislocation, head injury, chest pain, fall from height, and abdominal pain. We found that 1.2% of race participants presented to onsite medical services. The majority of complaints were minor and musculoskeletal in nature. Only 2% of those treated were transferred to hospital through EMS. This is consistent with other types of mass gathering events.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Determination of eight pesticides in Lycium barbarum by LC-MS/MS and dietary risk assessment A LC-MS/MS method for determination of eight pesticides (triadimefon, sulfoxaflor, flusilazole, tebuconazole, difenoconazole, amitraz, azoxystrobin, and thiophanate-methyl) in Lycium barbarum was established. The samples were extracted with acetonitrile, and then cleaned up by primary secondary amine. The extracts were diluted with 0.1% formic acid in water. The results showed that at the fortified levels of 0.01-10mg/kg, the average recoveries of these pesticides ranged from 82.1% to 96.2% with the relative standard deviations lower than 7%. The half-lives of eight pesticides were 1.3-5.0days in Lycium barbarum fruits. The pre-harvest interval of all pesticides mentioned above were investigated. Tebuconazole (14days), sulfoxaflor (14days) and flusilazole (28days) have longer pre-harvest interval than the others which have 7days. The dietary risks, assessed as hazard quotients, were far below 100%. The results showed that the eight pesticides applied to Lycium barbarum were comparably safe for the consumer.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A novel combination treatment to stimulate bone healing and regeneration under hypoxic conditions: photobiomodulation and melatonin Melatonin has anabolic effects on the bone, even under hypoxia, and laser irradiation has been shown to improve osteoblastic differentiation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether laser irradiation and melatonin would have synergistic effects on osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization under hypoxic conditions. MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to 1% oxygen tension for the hypoxia condition. The cells were divided into four groups: G1 - osteoblast differentiation medium only (as the hypoxic condition), G2 - treatment with 50 Î¼M melatonin only, G3 - laser irradiation (808 nm, 80 mW, GaAlAs diode) only, and G4 - treatment with 50 Î¼M melatonin and laser irradiation (808 nm, 80 mW, GaAlAs diode). Immunoblotting showed that osterix expression was markedly increased in the melatonin - treated and laser-irradiated cells at 48 and 72 h. In addition, alkaline phosphatase activity significantly increased and continued to rise throughout the experiment. Alizarin Red staining showed markedly increased mineralized nodules as compared with only melatonin - treated or laser-irradiated cells at day 7, which significantly increased by day 14. Moreover, when melatonin - treated cells were laser-irradiated, the differentiation and mineralization of cells were found to involve p38 MAPK and PRKD1 signaling mechanisms. However, the enhanced effects of laser irradiation with melatonin were markedly inhibited when the cells were treated with luzindole, a selective melatonin receptor antagonist. Therefore, we concluded that laser irradiation could promote the effect of melatonin on the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells under hypoxic conditions, and that this process is mediated through melatonin 1/2 receptors and PKRD / p38 signaling pathways.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Forest protected areas governance in Zimbabwe: Shift needed away from a long history of local community exclusion In this literature review based paper we explored the concept of exclusion of local communities from accessing resources in forest protected areas (FPAs) in Zimbabwe. We discussed the colonial and post - colonial forms, causes and mechanisms of exclusion and their social, economic and ecological outcomes. We examined the range of powers embodied in and exercised through various mechanisms, processes and social relations and their impact on local communities ' access to FPA resources and associated benefits along the historical trajectory of forest governance in Zimbabwe. Results showed that the forms and extent of exclusion changed over time in tandem with the shifting political and economic landscape. During the colonial period, it was total exclusion whereby people were evicted from forest land as well as being denied access to basic resources for their livelihoods. Local communities ' access to low value FPA resources improved during the post-colonial period but access to high value resources like commercial timber as well as sharing income benefits derived from FPA commercial activities remained a pipe dream. Regulation, legitimation, force and markets constituted the mixture of the power elements that FPA governing authorities used to exclude local communities. These powers remained intact despite attempts at collaborative governance in the 1990s. However, from the year 2000, local communities expressed their dissatisfaction with the centralised exclusionary governance system by invading the FPAs rendering them ungovernable. There is therefore a need for policy reform within the FPA sector to improve the current dire situation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Bacteria from Wheat and Cucurbit Plant Roots Metabolize PAHs and Aromatic Root Exudates: Implications for Rhizodegradation The chemical interaction between plants and bacteria in the root zone can lead to soil decontamination. Bacteria which degrade PAHs have been isolated from the rhizospheres of plant species with varied biological traits, however, it is not known what phytochemicals promote contaminant degradation. One monocot and two dicotyledon plants were grown in PAH - contaminated soil from a manufactured gas plant (MGP) site. A phytotoxicity assay confirmed greater soil decontamination in rhizospheres when compared to bulk soil controls. Bacteria were isolated from plant roots (rhizobacteria) and selected for growth on anthracene and chrysene on PAH - amended plates. Rhizosphere isolates metabolized 3- and 4-ring PAHs and PAH catabolic intermediates in liquid incubations. Aromatic root exudate compounds, namely flavonoids and simple phenols, were also substrates for isolated rhizobacteria. In particular, the phenolic compounds - morin, caffeic acid, and protocatechuic acid - appear to be linked to bacterial degradation of 3- and 4- ring PAHs in the rhizosphere.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A Fast Peak-Searching Algorithm for Ultrasonic Elastography Tissue axial strain estimation with ultrasound elastography has become a hot field in recent years. However, for keypoints tracking-based elastography algorithms, locating extrema in multimodal ultrasonic radiofrequency signals is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a new method is proposed to locate the local maxima and minima of the RF signals directly without derivation operation. This algorithm can accurately locate extrema even if disturbed peaks resulting from different noise exist. Furthermore, the new algorithm can speed up approximately 79% of the implementation process as compared with the standard cross-correlation method on the same computing platform. In addition, the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio are also significantly improved with this new method.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Relationship between polycythemia and in-hospital mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism Pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequent in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and associated with high mortality. This multi-center retrospective study was performed to investigate if secondary polycythemia is associated with in-hospital mortality in COPD patients with low-risk PE. We identified COPD patients with proven PE between October, 2005 and October, 2015. Patients in risk classes III-V on the basis of the PESI score were excluded. We extracted demographic, clinical and laboratory information at the time of admission from medical records. All subjects were followed until hospital discharge to identify all-cause mortality. We enrolled 629 consecutive patients with COPD and PE at low risk: 132 of them (21.0%) with and 497 (79.0%) without secondary polycythemia. Compared with those without polycythemia, the polycythemia group had significantly lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) level (0.9Â±0.3 vs. 1.4Â±0.5, P=0.000), lower PaO2 and SpO2 as well as higher PaCO2 (P=0.03, P=0.03 and P=0.000, respectively). COPD patients with polycythemia had a higher proportion of arrhythmia in electrocardiogram (ECG) (49.5% vs. 35.7%, P=0.02), a longer hospital duration time (15.3Â±10.1 vs. 9.7Â±9.1, P=0.001), a higher mechanical ventilation rate (noninvasive and invasive, 51.7% vs. 30.3%, P=0.04 and 31.0% vs. 7.9%, P=0.04, respectively), and a higher in-hospital mortality (12.1% vs. 6.6%, P=0.04). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that polycythemia was associated with mortality in COPD patients with low-risk PE (adjusted OR 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.66). Polycythemia is an independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital mortality in COPD patients with PE at low risk.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A taxonomic revision of the ground spiders of the genus Apopyllus (Araneae: Gnaphosidae) The American gnaphosid genus Apopyllus Platnick & Shadab is found from southern Mexico to southern Argentina. It can be diagnosed by the complex shape of the RTA, by the membranous tegular extension, the long coiled embolus, the retrolateral incision on the cymbium, the long convoluted copulatory duct extending anteriorly to the copulatory openings and by the presence of paramedian epigynal pockets and of an anterior ridge on the epigynum. The RTA characters are important in species taxonomy but the complex shape and variation of the RTA hampers identification, especially regarding the two most common species: A. suavis (Simon) and A. silvestrii (Simon). In this paper the genus is revised, the genital morphology is described, and homology between its components and those of other genera is discussed. Apopyllus suavis is considered a senior synonym of Apopyllus pauper (Mello-LeitÃ£o) and A. iheringi (Mello-LeitÃ£o).

"Diffusion kurtosis imaging of the liver at 3 Tesla: in vivo comparison to standard diffusion-weighted imaging Background Functional techniques like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are gaining more and more importance in liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an advanced technique that might help to overcome current limitations of DWI. Purpose To evaluate DKI for the differentiation of hepatic lesions in comparison to conventional DWI at 3 Tesla. Material and Methods Fifty-six consecutive patients were examined using a routine abdominal MR protocol at 3 Tesla which included DWI with b-values of 50, 400, 800, and 1000 s/mm(2). Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated applying a standard mono-exponential fit, while a non-Gaussian kurtosis fit was used to obtain DKI maps. ADC as well as Kurtosis-corrected diffusion (D) values were quantified by region of interest analysis and compared between lesions. Results Sixty-eight hepatic lesions (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] [n = 25]; hepatic adenoma [n = 4], cysts [n = 18]; hepatic hemangioma [HH] [n = 18]; and focal nodular hyperplasia [n = 3]) were identified. Differentiation of malignant and benign lesions was possible based on both DWI ADC as well as DKI D-values (P values were in the range of 0.04 to < 0.0001). Conclusion In vivo abdominal DKI calculated using standard b-values is feasible and enables quantitative differentiation between malignant and benign liver lesions. Assessment of conventional ADC values leads to similar results when using b-values below 1000 s/mm(2) for DKI calculation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Risk and protective factors associated with adolescent girls' substance use: Data from a nationwide Facebook sample Despite overall reductions in teenage substance use, adolescent girls ' rates of substance use remain unacceptably high. This article examines whether girls ' substance use is associated with general risk and protective factors (goal setting, problem solving, refusal skills, peer use, and self-efficacy) and gender - specific risk and protective factors (communication style, coping skills, self-esteem, body image, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression). Cross-sectional data were collected in 2013 via online surveys from a nationwide sample of adolescent girls (N = 788), aged 13 and 14 years, who were recruited through Facebook. In multivariate analyses, controlling for correlates of adolescent substance use, 11 of the 13 general and gender - specific risk and protective factors were consistently associated with past-month alcohol, cigarette, and other drug use in the expected direction; past-month marijuana use was associated with 8 of the 13 factors. Refusal skill s, peer use, coping, and depressive mood were most consistently and strongly associated with substance use. Substance abuse prevention programs targeting adolescent girls should focus on such general risk and protective factors as problem solving, refusal skill s, peer influences, and self-efficacy, as well as such gender - specific risk and protective factors as communication style, coping, self-esteem, body image, perceived stress, and mood management.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Comparison of the Effects of Subcutaneous Versus Continuous Infusion of Heparin on Key Inflammatory Parameters Following Sepsis Sepsis is the result of the interaction between inflammatory mediators and coagulation pathway. Unfractionated heparin may play a role as an anti-inflammatory agent beyond its anticoagulatory effect in sepsis. As a result, it may cause reduction in organ failure rate in patients with sepsis due to its impact on both inflammatory and coagulation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of heparin in sepsis. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as an inflammatory mediator and urinary necoutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a marker of kidney injury were investigated. This prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 32- bed intensive care unit. Thirty patients with sepsis were randomized to receive heparin infusion of 500 units/hour or 5000 units of heparin three times a day, subcutaneously. The plasma level of PAI-1 and urinary level of NGAL were determined at day 0, 2 and 7. The infusion group had a lower plasma PAI-1 level compared to the subcutaneous group at day 7 (11.3 Â± 1.6 vs. 16.5 Â± 4.2; P = 0.003). The urinary NGAL level was lower in the infusion group at day 2 (131.3 Â± 11.9 vs. 151.2 Â± 20.6; P = 0.014); however, at day 7 the NGAL level was decreased in the subcutaneous group as much as the infusion group and there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores between the two groups at day 0, 2 and 7. Low-dose heparin infusion compared to subcutaneous heparin can decrease the plasma PAI-1 and urinary NGAL levels more rapidly. It can be related to anti-inflammatory effects of heparin, which may be more prominent in infusion route.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Elevated Plasma Level of Interferon-Î»1 in Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria: Upregulated Expression in CD8(+) and Epithelial Cells and Induction of Inflammatory Cell Accumulation Interferon- (IFN-) Î»1 is regarded as a potent bio-active molecule in innate immunity. However, little is known about its role in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). We therefore investigated expression of IFN-Î»1 in CSU, its cellular location, and its influence on inflammatory cell accumulation by using flow cytometry analysis, skin tissue dispersion, immunohistochemical stain, and a mouse peritoneal inflammation model. The results showed that level of IFN-Î»1 was 2.0-fold higher in plasma of the patients with CSU than the level in healthy control (HC) subjects. Among leukocytes examined, only CD8(+) T cells expressed more IFN-Î»1 in CSU blood. Double labeling immunohistochemical staining revealed that IFN-Î»1 (+) inflammatory cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, B cells, neutrophils, and macrophages were mainly located in dermis, whereas epidermis tissue highly expressed IFN-Î»1. IFN-Î»1 induced a dose-dependent increase in number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in the peritoneum of mice at 6 h following injection, which was inhibited by pretreatment of the animals with anti-intercellular adhesion molecule- (ICAM-) 1 and/or anti-L-selectin antibodies. In conclusion, IFN-Î»1 is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of CSU. Blocking IFN-Î»1 production may help to reduce the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the involved CSU skin.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Intracellular Metabolism of Î±,Î²-Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds, Acrolein, Crotonaldehyde and Methyl Vinyl Ketone, Active Toxicants in Cigarette Smoke: Participation of Glutathione Conjugation Ability and Aldehyde-Ketone Sensitive Reductase Activity The major toxicants in cigarette smoke, Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehydes, such as acrolein (ACR) and crotonaldehyde (CA), and Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketone, methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), are known to form Michael-type adducts with glutathione (GSH) and consequently cause intracellular GSH depletion, which is involved in cigarette smoke - induced cytotoxicity. We have previously clarified that exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) of a mouse melanoma cell culture medium causes rapid reduction of intracellular GSH levels, and that the GSH - MVK adduct can be detected by LC/MS analysis while the GSH - CA adduct is hardly detected. In the present study, to clarify why the GSH - CA adduct is difficult to detect in the cell medium, we conducted detailed investigation of the structures of the reaction products of ACR, CA, MVK and CSE in the GSH solution or the cell culture medium. The mass spectra indicated that in the presence of the cells, the GSH - CA and GSH - ACR adducts were almost not detected while their corresponding alcohols were detected. On the other hand, both the GSH - MVK adducts and their reduced products were detected. In the absence of the cells, the reaction of GSH with all Î±,Î²-unsaturated carbonyls produced only their corresponding adducts. These results show that the GSH adducts of Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehydes, CA and ACR, are quickly reduced by certain intracellular carbonyl reductase(s) and excreted from the cells, unlike the GSH adduct of Î±,Î²-unsaturated ketone, MVK. Such a difference in reactivity to the carbonyl reductase might be related to differences in the cytotoxicity of Î±,Î²-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Biomimetic biodegradable artificial antigen presenting cells synergize with PD-1 blockade to treat melanoma Biomimetic materials that target the immune system and generate an anti-tumor responses hold promise in augmenting cancer immunotherapy. These synthetic materials can be engineered and optimized for their biodegradability, physical parameters such as shape and size, and controlled release of immune-modulators. As these new platforms enter the playing field, it is imperative to understand their interaction with existing immunotherapies since single - targeted approaches have limited efficacy. Here, we investigate the synergy between a PLGA -based artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC) and a checkpoint blockade molecule, anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). The combination of antigen - specific aAPC -based activation and anti-PD-1 mAb checkpoint blockade induced the greatest IFN-Î³ secretion by CD8+ T cells in vitro. Combination treatment also acted synergistically in an in vivo murine melanoma model to result in delayed tumor growth and extended survival, while either treatment alone had no effect. This was shown mechanistically to be due to decreased PD-1 expression and increased antigen - specific proliferation of CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment and spleen. Thus, biomaterial -based therapy can synergize with other immunotherapies and motivates the translation of biomimetic combinatorial treatments.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Comparison of plasma ammonia results from seven different automated platforms in use throughout Central Australia The clinical catchment area for the Metabolic service at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia, covers nearly 2.5millionkm(2). Care of children with metabolic disorders in these remote areas is assisted from Adelaide, and at times, using plasma ammonia results from laboratories up to 3000km away. There are seven different platforms measuring plasma ammonia within this vast clinical catchment area. Hence, a correlation study was conducted to examine the relationship between plasma ammonia results from the seven different platforms in use throughout central Australia. Multiple aliquots of plasma from remainder EDTA samples for haematological investigations were frozen. Samples were then dispatched on dry ice to the laboratories being correlated. At an agreed date and time correlation samples were thawed and plasma ammonia measured. Passing-Bablok regression analysis showed slopes ranging from 1.00 to 1.10 and y-intercepts ranging from -10Î¼mol/L to 1Î¼mol/L. Despite the absence of a reference method or reference material and troublesome pre-analytical effects in ammonia measurement, plasma ammonia results from the different platforms in general compare well. The study also demonstrates that samples for ammonia measurement can be transported over great distances and still correlate well. Furthermore, a common reference interval for plasma ammonia may be a possibility.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The role of leptin in energy expenditure: The hypothalamic perspective The adipocyte derived hormone leptin is a peripheral signal that informs the brain about the metabolic status of an organism. Although traditionally viewed as an appetite suppressing hormone, studies in the past decade have highlighted the role of leptin in energy expenditure. Leptin has been shown to increase energy expenditure in particular through its effects on the cardiovascular system and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis via the hypothalamus. The current review summarizes the role of leptin signaling in various hypothalamic nuclei and its effects on the sympathetic nervous system to influence blood pressure, heart rate and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Specifically, the role of leptin signaling on three different hypothalamic nuclei, the dorsomedial hypothalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the arcuate nucleus, is reviewed. It is known that all these brain regions influence the sympathetic nervous system activity and thereby regulate BAT thermogenesis and the cardiovascular system. Thus, the current work focuses on how leptin signaling in specific neuronal populations within these hypothalamic nuclei influences certain aspects of energy expenditure.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Early Cognitive Deficits in Type 2 Diabetes: A Population-Based Study Evidence links type 2 diabetes to dementia risk. However, our knowledge on the initial cognitive deficits in diabetic individuals and the factors that might promote such deficits is still limited. This study aimed to identify the cognitive domains initially impaired by diabetes and the factors that play a role in this first stage. Within the population-based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, 2305 cognitively intact participants aged â¥60 y were identified. Attention / working memory, perceptual speed, category fluency, letter fluency, semantic memory, and episodic memory were assessed. Diabetes (controlled and uncontrolled) and prediabetes were ascertained by clinicians, who also collected information on vascular disorders (hypertension, heart diseases, and stroke) and vascular risk factors (VRFs, including smoking and overweight / obesity). Data were analyzed with linear regression models. Overall, 196 participants (8.5%) had diabetes, of which 144 (73.5%) had elevated glycaemia (uncontrolled diabetes); 571 (24.8%) persons had prediabetes. In addition, diabetes, mainly uncontrolled, was related to lower performance in perceptual speed (Î² - 1.10 [95% CI - 1.98, - 0.23]), category fluency (Î² - 1.27 [95% CI - 2.52, - 0.03]), and digit span forward (Î² - 0.35 [95% CI - 0.54, - 0.17]). Critically, these associations were present only among APOEÉ4 non-carriers. The associations of diabetes with perceptual speed and category fluency were present only among participants with VRFs or vascular disorders. Diabetes, especially uncontrolled diabetes, is associated with poorer performance in perceptual speed, category fluency, and attention / primary memory.

"Cognitive assessment of pycnogenol therapy following traumatic brain injury We have previously shown that pycnogenol (PYC) increases antioxidants, decreases oxidative stress, suppresses neuroinflammation and enhances synaptic plasticity following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we investigate the effects of PYC on cognitive function following a controlled cortical impact (CCI). Adult Sprague-Dawley rats received a CCI injury followed by an intraperitoneal injection of PYC (50 or 100mg/kg). Seven days post trauma, subjects were evaluated in a Morris water maze (MWM) and evaluated for changes in lesion volume. Some animals were evaluated at 48h for hippocampal Fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining. The highest dose of PYC therapy significantly reduced lesion volume, with no improvement in MWM compared to vehicle controls. PYC failed to reduce the total number of FJB positive neurons in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the reduction of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are not the key components of the secondary injury that contribute to cognitive deficits following TBI.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Assessment of the interaction of Portland cement-based materials with blood and tissue fluids using an animal model Portland cement used in the construction industry improves its properties when wet. Since most dental materials are used in a moist environment, Portland cement has been developed for use in dentistry. The first generation material is mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), used in surgical procedures, thus in contact with blood. The aim of this study was to compare the setting of MTA in vitro and in vivo in contact with blood by subcutaneous implantation in rats. The tissue reaction to the material was also investigated. ProRoot MTA (Dentsply) was implanted in the subcutaneous tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats in opposite flanks and left in situ for 3 months. Furthermore the material was also stored in physiological solution in vitro. At the end of the incubation time, tissue histology and material characterization were performed. Surface assessment showed the formation of calcium carbonate for both environments. The bismuth was evident in the tissues thus showing heavy element contamination of the animal specimen. The tissue histology showed a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate associated with the MTA. MTA interacts with the host tissues and causes a chronic inflammatory reaction when implanted subcutaneously. Hydration in vivo proceeds similarly to the in vitro model with some differences particularly in the bismuth oxide leaching patterns.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Improvement in advanced pancreatic cancer survival with novel chemotherapeutic strategies - experience of a community based hospital Background: New chemotherapeutic strategies for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have been shown to improve survival in randomized clinical trials. Little is known about the use of such chemotherapies and their benefit in community-based hospitals. This retrospective study analyzes the overall survival of these patients under "" real life conditions "" before and after the introduction of FOLFIRINOX in 2011. Methods: We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with PDAC who were treated at our hospital from 2011 to June 2014 (2011+ cohort) and 2004 to 2010 (historical cohort). Patients were included if PDAC was diagnosed in a locally advanced or metastatic state and at least 1 cycle of chemotherapy was given. Survival was assessed until April 2016. Patients with FOLFIRINOX were further analyzed regarding drug administration and side effects. Results: 128 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of the 74 patients in the historical cohort, 62 patients received Gemcitabine. Of the 54 patients diagnosed between 2011 and June 2014, 28 patients received FOLFIRINOX and 22 Gemcitabine as the first-line chemotherapy. Only 34 % of the patients in the historical cohort received a second-line chemotherapy in comparison to 69 % in the 2011+ cohort. Median overall survival (OS) showed a survival of 13.1 months (95 % CI; 11.6 - 14.5) for the 2011+ cohort compared to 9.6 months (95 % CI; 6.1 - 13.1) in the historical group. Conclusion: This study shows a marked improvement in survival of patients diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC in a community-based hospital during the past 4 years. The most likely reasons are the use of new polychemotherapies like FOLFIRINOX and the use of second-line chemotherapy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Participation in and adherence to physical exercise after completion of primary cancer treatment The purpose of this study was to identify demographic, clinical, psychosocial, physical and environmental factors that are associated with participation in and adherence to a combined resistance and endurance exercise program among cancer survivors, shortly after completion of primary cancer treatment. Data from the randomized controlled Resistance and Endurance exercise After ChemoTherapy (REACT) study were used for this study. The participants of the REACT study were randomly allocated to either a high intensity (HI) or low -to- moderate intensity (LMI) exercise program. Patients ' participation rate was defined as the cancer survivors ' decision to participate in the REACT study. Exercise adherence reflected participants ' attendance to the scheduled exercise sessions and their compliance to the prescribed exercises. High session attendance rates were defined as attending at least 80 % of the sessions. High compliance rates were defined as performing at least of 90 % of the prescribed exercise across all sessions. Correlates of exercise adherence were studied separately for HI and LMI exercise. Demographic, clinical, and physical factors were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Relevant clinical information was extracted from medical records. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to identify correlates that were significantly associated with participation, high session attendance, high compliance with resistance and high compliance with endurance exercises. Participants were more likely to have higher education, be non-smokers, have lower psychological distress, higher outcome expectations, and perceive more exercise barriers than non-participants. In HI exercise, higher self-efficacy was significantly associated with high session attendance and high compliance with endurance exercises, and lower psychological distress was significantly associated with high compliance with resistance exercise s. In LMI exercise, being a non-smoker was significantly associated with high compliance with resistance exercises and higher BMI was significantly associated with high compliance with resistance and endurance exercises. Furthermore, breast cancer survivors were less likely to report high compliance with resistance and endurance exercises in LMI exercise compared to survivors of other types of cancer. The discriminative ability of the multivariable models ranged from 0.62 to 0.75. Several demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors were associated with participation in and adherence to exercise among cancer survivors. Psychosocial factors were more strongly associated with adherence in HI than LMI exercise.

"A Student - Led Introduction to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health for First- Year Medical Students Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals face significant health disparities. This is in part because many physicians are not sensitive to, and/or are underprepared to address, LGBT - specific concerns. To help meet this need, we, a group of second- and fourth- year medical students with faculty oversight, organized a session on LGBT health for first- year medical students. The three second- year and one fourth- year student authors designed a mandatory session for the 167 first- years at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH. The 2-hour session consisted of a student - delivered presentation, a patient panel, and a small-group session. Students ' LGBT health knowledge and confidence in providing care were assessed anonymously before and after the session, and individuals ' pre - and post - session assessments were paired using student - generated identifiers. A total of 73 complete, matched pre -/ post - session assessments were received. Students ' familiarity with LGBT terminology and demographics increased significantly after the session. Students ' perceived preparedness and comfort in providing LGBT - specific care significantly improved in most areas as well. Students strongly praised the session, in particular the patient panel. A student - led educational session on LGBT health can effectively improve first- year medical students ' LGBT knowledge and confidence to provide care.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Blinking Phase-Change Nanocapsules Enable Background-Free Ultrasound Imaging Microbubbles are widely used as contrast agents to improve the diagnostic capability of conventional, highly speckled, low-contrast ultrasound imaging. However, while microbubbles can be used for molecular imaging, these agents are limited to the vascular space due to their large size (> 1 Î¼m). Smaller microbubbles are desired but their ultrasound visualization is limited due to lower echogenicity or higher resonant frequencies. Here we present nanometer scale, phase changing, blinking nanocapsules (BLInCs), which can be repeatedly optically triggered to provide transient contrast and enable background-free ultrasound imaging. In response to irradiation by near-infrared laser pulses, the BLInCs undergo cycles of rapid vaporization followed by recondensation into their native liquid state at body temperature. High frame rate ultrasound imaging measures the dynamic echogenicity changes associated with these controllable, periodic phase transitions. Using a newly developed image processing algorithm, the blinking particles are distinguished from tissue, providing a background-free image of the BLInCs while the underlying B-mode ultrasound image is used as an anatomical reference of the tissue. We demonstrate the function of BLInCs and the associated imaging technique in a tissue -mimicking phantom and in vivo for the identification of the sentinel lymph node. Our studies indicate that BLInCs may become a powerful tool to identify biological targets using a conventional ultrasound imaging system.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Recent coating developments for combination devices in orthopedic and dental applications: A literature review Orthopedic and dental implants have been used successfully for decades to replace or repair missing or damaged bones, joints, and teeth, thereby restoring patient function subsequent to disease or injury. However, although device success rates are generally high, patient outcomes are sometimes compromised due to device -related problems such as insufficient integration, local tissue inflammation, and infection. Many different types of surface coatings have been developed to address these shortcomings, including those that incorporate therapeutic agents to provide localized delivery to the surgical site. While these coatings hold enormous potential for improving device function, the list of requirements that an ideal combination coating must fulfill is extensive, and no single coating system today simultaneously addresses all of the criteria. Some of the primary challenges related to current coatings are non-optimal release kinetics, which most often are too rapid, the potential for inducing antibiotic resistance in target organisms, high susceptibility to mechanical abrasion and delamination, toxicity, difficult and expensive regulatory approval pathways, and high manufacturing costs. This review provides a survey of the most recent developments in the field, i.e., those published in the last 2-3years, with a particular focus on technologies that have potential for overcoming the most significant challenges facing therapeutically - loaded coatings. It is concluded that the ideal coating remains an unrealized target, but that advances in the field and emerging technologies are bringing it closer to reality. The significant amount of research currentl y being conducted in the field provides a level of optimism that many functional combination coating s will ultimately transition into clinical practice, significant ly improving patient outcomes.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Supramolecular Recognition of Amino Acids by Twisted Cucurbit[14]uril Binding interactions between twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and twenty standard amino acids (AAs) have been investigated by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in aqueous HCl solutions and in DMSO.

"Exposure to suicidal behaviors: A common suicide risk factor or a personal negative life event? Numerous suicide risk factors have been proposed but not adequately validated for epidemiology, treatment and prevention efforts. Exposures to suicidal behaviors (ESB), from family and friend suicide attempts and completions, were tested for validity as a suicidal risk factor and also for measurement and construct adequacy. An anonymous online survey yielded 713 participants (aged 18-71), who reported ESB, completed the Suicidal Affect-Behavior-Cognition Scale (SABCS), and comprised a broad spectrum on those variables. Tests of dimensionality and internal consistency showed the four ESB variables (attempts / completions through family / friends) were independent and did not form a common factor or an identifiable ESB latent trait. ESB variables were, however, associated with demographic and psychiatric histories. A battery of tests revealed no meaningful associations between ESB and total suicidality or suicide risk factors (social support, depression, anxiety, stress, satisfaction with life and emotional stability). In addition, in contrast to previous reports, young adults (n = 200; aged 18-20) showed no increased suicidality due to ESB. Results showed no validity for ESB as a common risk factor for suicidality or other psychopathology, or as a latent trait. ESB showed evidence as a personal negative life event with individual effects and interpretations.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"CT angiography for planning transcatheter aortic valve replacement using automated tube voltage selection: Image quality and radiation exposure To assess image quality and accuracy of CT angiography (CTA) for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) planning performed with 3rd generation dual-source CT (DSCT). We evaluated 125 patients who underwent TAVR - planning CTA on 3rd generation DSCT. A two-part protocol was performed including retrospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA (CCTA) and prospectively ECG-triggered aortoiliac CTA using 60mL of contrast medium. Automated tube voltage selection and advanced iterative reconstruction were applied. Effective dose (ED), signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated. Five-point scales were used for subjective image quality analysis. In patients who underwent TAVR, sizing parameters were obtained. Image quality was rated good to excellent in 97.6% of CCTA and 100% of aortoiliac CTAs. CTA studies at >100kV showed decreased objective image quality compared to 70-100kV (SNR, all pâ¤0.0459; CNR, all pâ¤0.0462). Mean ED increased continuously from 70 to >100kV (CCTA: 4.5Â±1.7mSv-13.6Â±2.9mSv, all pâ¤0.0233; aortoiliac CTA: 2.4Â±0.9mSv-6.8Â±2.7mSv, all pâ¤0.0414). In 39 patients TAVR was performed and annulus diameter was within the recommended range in all patients. No severe cardiac or vascular complications were noted. 3rd generation DSCT provides diagnostic image quality in TAVR - planning CTA and facilitates reliable assessment of TAVR device and delivery option while reducing radiation dose.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Disease management programs for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany: a longitudinal population-based descriptive study The primary aim of the disease management program (DMP) for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 is to improve the quality of health care and the treatment process. 12 years after its introduction in Germany, there is still no consensus as to whether DMP has been effective in reaching these goals. A retrospective longitudinal population-based study between 2004 and 2015 were conducted to evaluate the DMP for type 2 diabetes in Bavaria using routinely collected patient medical records hold from the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Bavaria. During the first 12 years of DMP, the number of participants increased continually to reach 580,222 in 2015. The proportion of participants older than 70 years increased during the observation from 41.6 to 51.1%. The percentage of smokers increased slightly from 9 to 11%. Similarly, the distribution of body mass index remained with approximately 50% of patients having a body mass index >30 kg/m(2). Control of HbA1c was without an appreciable change over the course, with between 8.3 and 9.4% of all patients with uncontrolled values higher than 8.5%. Prescription of metformin increased from 40.5% in 2004 to 54.1% in 2015. Among patients receiving insulin, the proportion receiving a combined therapy with metformin increased from 28.4% in 2004 to 50.8% in 2015. In contrast, the percentage with insulin monotherapy decreased from 55.4 to 33.7%. The proportion of patients with a diabetic education increased within the course from 12.8 to 29.3%. Data from the German DMP for type 2 diabetes demonstrates an improvement in the quality of care with respect to pharmacotherapy and patient education and therefore to an improved adherence to guidelines. However, no appreciable improvement was observed with regard to smoking status, obesity or HbA1c control.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"How should the optical tweezers experiment be used to characterize the red blood cell membrane mechanics? Stretching red blood cells using optical tweezers is a way to characterize the mechanical properties of their membrane by measuring the size of the cell in the direction of the stretching (axial diameter) and perpendicularly (transverse diameter). Recently, such data have been used in numerous publications to validate solvers dedicated to the computation of red blood cell dynamics under flow. In the present study, different mechanical models are used to simulate the stretching of red blood cells by optical tweezers. Results first show that the mechanical moduli of the membranes have to be adjusted as a function of the model used. In addition, by assessing the area dilation of the cells, the axial and transverse diameters measured in optical tweezers experiments are found to be insufficient to discriminate between models relevant to red blood cells or not. At last, it is shown that other quantities such as the height or the profile of the cell should be preferred for validation purposes since they are more sensitive to the membrane model.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Estrogen and Progesterone hormone receptor expression in oral cavity cancer Recent studies have shown an increase in the incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in younger patients. The hypothesis that tumors could be hormonally induced during pregnancy or in young female patients without the well-known risk factors alcohol or tobacco abuse seems to be plausible. Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERÎ±) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression were analyzed in normal oral mucosa (n=5), oral precursor lesions (simple hyperplasia, n=11; squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, SIN I-III, n=35), and OSCC specimen. OSCCs were stratified in a young female (n=7) study cohort and older patients (n=46). In the young female study cohort three patients (n=3/7) developed OSCC during or shortly after pregnancy. Breast cancer tissues were used as positive control for ERÎ± and PR expression. ERÎ± expression was found in four oral precursor lesions (squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, SIN I-III, n=4/35, 11%) and in five OSCC specimen (n=5/46, 11%). The five ERÎ± positive OSCC samples were older male patients. All patients within the young female study cohort were negatively stained for both ERÎ± and PR. ER expression could be regarded as a seldom risk factor for OSCC.

"Toxicity assessment of water-accommodated fractions from two different oils using a zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo - larval bioassay with a multilevel approach Petroleum compounds from chronic discharges and oil spills represent an important source of environmental pollution. To better understand the deleterious effects of these compounds, the toxicity of water-accommodated fractions (WAF) from two different oils (brut Arabian Light and Erika heavy fuel oils) were used in this study. Zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were exposed during 96 h at three WAF concentrations (1, 10 and 100% for Arabian Light and 10, 50 and 100% for Erika) in order to cover a wide range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations, representative of the levels found after environmental oil spills. Several endpoints were recorded at different levels of biological organization, including lethal endpoints, morphological abnormalities, photomotor behavioral responses, cardiac activity, DNA damage and exposure level measurements (EROD activity, cyp1a and PAH metabolites). Neither morphological nor behavioral or physiological alterations were observed after exposure to Arabian Light fractions. In contrast, the Erika fractions led a high degree of toxicity in early life stages of zebrafish. Despite of defense mechanisms induced by oil, acute toxic effects have been recorded including mortality, delayed hatching, high rates of developmental abnormalities, disrupted locomotor activity and cardiac failures at the highest PAH concentrations (âTPAHs=257,029Â±47,231ngÂ·L(-1)). Such differences in toxicity are likely related to the oil composition. The use of developing zebrafish is a good tool to identify wide range of detrimental effects and elucidate their underlying foundations. Our work highlights once more, the cardiotoxic action (and potentially neurotoxic) of petroleum -related PAHs.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Espindolol for the treatment and prevention of cachexia in patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international multicentre phase II study (the ACT-ONE trial) Cancer cachexia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with no widely approved treatment. The ACT-ONE trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, phase II multicentre trial in patients (25-80 years) with stages III or IV colorectal cancer or non-small cell lung cancer -related cachexia that tested two doses of espindolol (a novel non-selective Î² blocker with central 5-HT1a and partial Î²2 receptor agonist effects). The primary endpoint was the difference in the rate of weight change over 16 weeks (linear mixed-effect model for repeated measures) between high-dose espindolol and placebo. Eighty-seven patients were randomized centrally in blocks in a ratio 3:2:1 [42 high dose, 10 mg twice daily (bd):31 placebo :14 low dose, 2.5 mg bd]. High-dose espindolol produced a statistically and clinically significant weight gain (+0.54 kg/4 weeks, 95% CI 0.38-0.70) compared with a weight loss on placebo (-0.21 kg/4 weeks, 95% CI -0.37-0.05); P < 0.0001. High-dose espindolol produced a statistically significant increase in lean body mass, whilst changes in fat mass were neutral. Hand grip strength significantly (high dose -1.15 Â± 0.7 kg, placebo -3.51 Â± 0.8 kg change per 4 weeks; P = 0.0134), stair climbing power, and 6-min walk test non-significantly were all directionally in favour of high-dose espindolol. There were no clinically significant differences in safety signals or survival between treatment groups, although a numerical excess of dyspnoea was seen with high-dose espindolol (19.1%) compared with placebo (3.2%). This positive trial showed that espindolol 10 mg bd significantly reversed weight loss, improved fat free mass, and maintained fat mass in advanced colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer -related cachexia. This was associated with a significant improvement in handgrip strength, supporting the further investigation of 10 mg bd espindolol for the treatment of cancer cachexia. Although not powered to look at dose response, most treatment effects for low dose lay between high dose and placebo, suggesting that there may be a dose response in the effects of espindolol.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Heart rate variability: Pre-deployment predictor of post-deployment PTSD symptoms Heart rate variability is a physiological measure associated with autonomic nervous system activity. This study hypothesized that lower pre-deployment HRV would be associated with higher post-deployment post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Three-hundred-forty-three Army National Guard soldiers enrolled in the Warriors Achieving Resilience (WAR) study were analyzed. The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity using the PTSD Checklist - Military version (PCL) measured at baseline, 3- and 12- month post-deployment. Heart rate variability predictor variables included: high frequency power (HF) and standard deviation of the normal cardiac inter-beat interval (SDNN). Generalized linear mixed models revealed that the pre-deployment PCL * ln(HF) interaction term was significant (p<0.0001). Pre-deployment SDNN was not a significant predictor of post-deployment PCL. Covariates included age, pre-deployment PCL, race / ethnicity, marital status, tobacco use, childhood abuse, pre-deployment traumatic brain injury, and previous combat zone deployment.

"A Rational Engineering Strategy for Designing Protein A-Binding Camelid Single-Domain Antibodies Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) and streptococcal protein G (SpG) affinity chromatography are the gold standards for purifying monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in therapeutic applications. However, camelid VHH single-domain Abs (sdAbs or VHHs) are not bound by SpG and only sporadically bound by SpA. Currently, VHHs require affinity tag-based purification, which limits their therapeutic potential and adds considerable complexity and cost to their production. Here we describe a simple and rapid mutagenesis -based approach designed to confer SpA binding upon a priori non-SpA-binding VHHs. We show that SpA binding of VHHs is determined primarily by the same set of residues as in human mAbs, albeit with an unexpected degree of tolerance to substitutions at certain core and non-core positions and some limited dependence on at least one residue outside the SpA interface, and that SpA binding could be successfully introduced into five VHHs against three different targets with no adverse effects on expression yield or antigen binding. Next-generation sequencing of llama, alpaca and dromedary VHH repertoires suggested that species differences in SpA binding may result from frequency variation in specific deleterious polymorphisms, especially Ile57. Thus, the SpA binding phenotype of camelid VHHs can be easily modulated to take advantage of tag-less purification techniques, although the frequency with which this is required may depend on the source species.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Modeling viscous dissipation during vocal fold contact: the influence of tissue viscosity and thickness with implications for hydration The mechanics of vocal fold contact during phonation is known to play a crucial role in both normal and pathological speech production, though the underlying physics is not well understood. Herein, a viscoelastic model of the stresses during vocal fold contact is developed. This model assumes the cover to be a poroelastic structure wherein interstitial fluid translocates in response to mechanical squeezing. The maximum interstitial fluid pressure is found to generally increase with decreasing viscous dissipation and/or decreasing tissue elasticity. A global minimum in the total contact stress, comprising interstitial fluid pressure and elastic stress in the tissue, is observed over the studied dimensionless parameter range. Interestingly, physiologically reasonable estimates for the governing parameters fall within this global minimum region. The model is validated against prior experimental and computational work, wherein the predicted contact stress magnitude and impact duration agree well with published results. Lastly, observations of the potential relationship between vocal fold hydration and increased risk of tissue damage are discussed based upon model predictions of stress as functions of cover layer thickness and viscosity.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Co-ChIP enables genome-wide mapping of histone mark co-occurrence at single-molecule resolution Histone modifications play an important role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, but despite the large amount of genome-wide histone modification data collected in different cells and tissues, little is known about co-occurrence of modifications on the same nucleosome. Here we present a genome-wide quantitative method for combinatorial indexed chromatin immunoprecipitation (co-ChIP) to characterize co-occurrence of histone modifications on nucleosomes. Using co-ChIP, we study the genome-wide co-occurrence of 14 chromatin marks (70 pairwise combinations), and find previously undescribed co-occurrence patterns, including the co-occurrence of H3K9me1 and H3K27ac in super-enhancers. Finally, we apply co-ChIP to measure the distribution of the bivalent H3K4me3 - H3K27me3 domains in two distinct mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) states and in four adult tissues. We observe dynamic changes in 5,786 regions and discover both loss and de novo gain of bivalency in key tissue-specific regulatory genes, suggesting a functional role for bivalent domains during different stages of development. These results show that co-ChIP can reveal the complex interactions between histone modifications.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Successful Management of Acquired Hemophilia A Associated with Bullous Pemphigoid: A Case Report and Review of the Literature Background. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare condition, due to the spontaneous formation of neutralizing antibodies against endogenous factor VIII. About half the cases are associated with pregnancy, postpartum, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, or adverse drug reactions. Symptoms include severe and unexpected bleeding that may prove life-threatening. Case Study. We report a case of AHA associated with bullous pemphigoid (BP), a chronic, autoimmune, subepidermal, blistering skin disease. To our knowledge, this is the 25th documented case of such an association. Following treatment for less than 3 months consisting of methylprednisolone at decreasing dose levels along with four courses of rituximab (monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 protein), AHA was completely cured and BP well-controlled. Conclusions. This report illustrates a rare association of AHA and BP, supporting the possibility of eradicating the inhibitor with a well-conducted short-term treatment.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Internet Gaming Disorder Explains Unique Variance in Psychological Distress and Disability After Controlling for Comorbid Depression, OCD, ADHD, and Anxiety This study extends knowledge about the relationship of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) to other established mental disorders by exploring comorbidities with anxiety, depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and assessing whether IGD accounts for unique variance in distress and disability. An online survey was completed by a convenience sample that engages in Internet gaming (N = 404). Participants meeting criteria for IGD based on the Personal Internet Gaming Disorder Evaluation-9 (PIE-9) reported higher comorbidity with depression, OCD, ADHD, and anxiety compared with those who did not meet the IGD criteria. IGD explained a small proportion of unique variance in distress (1%) and disability (3%). IGD accounted for a larger proportion of unique variance in disability than anxiety and ADHD, and a similar proportion to depression.

"Parallel-processing continuous-flow device for optimization - free polymerase chain reaction A parallel-processing four-station polymerase chain reaction (PCR) device has been developed, which performs continuous-flow PCR without optimization of the annealing temperature. Since the annealing temperature of each station can be controlled independently, the device covers an annealing temperature range of 50-68 Â°C, which is wide enough to perform PCR for any DNA fragment regardless of its optimum annealing condition. This arrangement lets us continuously obtain an amplified amount of a DNA fragment at least from one of the stations. The device consists of four identical cylindrical stations (diameter 20 mm, height 55 mm). A polytetrafluoroethylene capillary reactor (length 2 m, I.D. 100 Î¼m, O.D. 400 Î¼m) is wound helically up around each station. The whole assembly is designed to minimize the number of heating blocks (for providing temperatures of denaturation, annealing, and extension) to be seven and to shape a compact cube (height 55 mm, base 60 mm Ã 60 mm). The reproducibility for continuous-flow PCR is reasonably high (run -to- run and station -to- station relative standard deviation of their amplification is lower than 6 % and about 4 %, respectively). Performance on the optimization - free DNA amplification has been evaluated with four DNA samples with different annealing conditions and product sizes (323, 608, 828, and 1101 bp), which has demonstrated that in all cases, PCR is successful at least on one station. In addition, three DNA fragment s with different lengths (323, 1101, and 2836 bp) have been successfully amplified in a segmented - flow mode without the carry-over contamination between segments. This result suggests that this device could serve as the PCR module of a continuous-flow high-throughput on-line total DNA analysis system integrating all necessary modules from cell lysis / DNA extraction to PCR product analysis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Associations between major life events and adherence, glycemic control, and psychosocial characteristics in teens with type 1 diabetes This cross-sectional study assessed the type of major life events occurring in a contemporary sample of teens with type 1 diabetes and the association between event frequency and demographic, diabetes management, and psychosocial characteristics. Parents of 178 teens completed the Life Events Checklist to report major events teens had experienced in the last year: 42% experienced 0 to 1 event (n = 75), 32% experienced 2 to 3 events (n = 57), and 26% experienced 4+ events (n = 46). Teens and parents completed validated measures of treatment adherence, diabetes -specific self-efficacy, quality of life, and diabetes -specific family conflict. Parent-youth interview and chart review provided demographics and diabetes management data. Mean number of events / teen was 2.6 Â± 2.7 (range = 0-15). The most common events were "" Hospitalization of a family member "" (24%), "" Getting a bad report card "" (20%), ""Serious arguments between parents "" (19%), and "" Serious illness / injury in a family member "" (19%). Compared with teens experiencing 0 to 1 event, teens experiencing 4+ events were less likely to have married parents (P = .01) and a parent with a college degree (P = .006). Teen s with 4+ events had significantly poorer adherence (P = .002 teen, P = .02 parent), lower self-efficacy (P = .03 teen, P < .0001 parent), poorer quality of life (P < .0001 teen, P < .0001 parent), and more conflict (P = .006 teen, P = .02 parent) than teens with fewer events. In a multivariate model (R (2) = 0.21, P < .0001) controlling for demographic and diabetes management characteristics, fewer events was associated with lower A1c (P = .0009). Occurrence of more major life events was associated with poorer diabetes care and A1c and more negative psychosocial qualities in teens with type 1 diabetes.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Envisioning and Leading Organizational Transformation: One Organ Procurement Organization's Journey In 2012, one organ procurement organization (OPO) welcomed a new President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). This OPO, LifeShare Transplant Donor Services of Oklahoma (LifeShare), had just celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2011. While LifeShare was well-established chronologically, growth in organ donors and organs transplanted from these donors had occurred at a much slower rate during the collaborative era and afterward (2003-2011) than the donor / transplant growth the United States (US), as a whole, had experienced. While this performance had been stable, it was in the lower quartile of US OPO s on a per capita basis (organs transplanted per donor), and conversion rates were unremarkable. It was the sense of the OPO and donation service area (DSA) constituents that there was an opportunity for growth. It was under this premise that the new CEO was recruited in late 2011 and assumed leadership in February 2012. It important to note that the new CEO (the author) found LifeShare possessed numerous significant assets upon which to build. These included a strong core of committed and dedicated staff, a supportive Board, supportive transplant centers, and a strong state donor registry. Therefore, it was apparent that, while achieving the DSA's potential would require a transformation of the organization, the transformation did not necessarily require replacing core staff, often a common step undertaken by new chief executives. Beginning in 2012, the CEO sought to transform both the culture and the operation of the organization by focusing on a short list of key strategies. Culturally, three primary initiatives were undertaken: leadership development, staff development, and establishing "" organizational clarity "". Operationally, the primary focus was identifying organ donor potential and then, based upon the opportunities for improvement, focusing on operational policies and practices. As LifeShare 's team began to identify pockets of unrealized potential donors, recognized best practices were deployed to areas of opportunity, including responding to all vented referrals, implementation of dedicated family requestors, broadening of already-existing in-house coordinator programs, and aggressive expansion of the donors after cardiac death (DCD) program. From 2008 through 2011, the four years prior to the organization beginning its change journey, LifeShare recovered 344 organ donors from which 1,007 organs were transplanted in 48 months. During the first 48 months of the change journey (2012 through 2015), 498 organ donors (+44.8%) provided 1,536 organs transplanted (+52.5%). DCD donors increased from 22 to 91 (+413.4%) and brain death (BD) donors from 322 to 407 (+26.4%). While the rate of growth is slowing somewhat, the first eight months of 2016 continue to show a percentage growth over 2015 in double digits for both organ donors and organs transplanted. Clearly, our results have been transformed and continue to be transformed. A cultural foundation for both leadership and staff, combined with a single-minded focus on maximizing recovery of potential organ donors and maximizing transplantation of every potential organ, has allowed us to achieve exceptional growth rates on a scale that has resulted in more than 500 additional organs transplanted and lives saved over the last four years when compared to pre-change results.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Long Non-Coding RNA SNHG6 as a Potential Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Long Non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to all non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. Their critical roles in different biological pathways have been already well established. Altered expression of lncRNAs can be involved in the cancer initiation and/or progression. Since patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are usually diagnosed in late stages, developing diagnostic methods seems to be essential. In this study, the expression levels of different lncRNAs were systematically analysed in different genomic and transcriptome datasets. The analyses showed that SNHG6 is among the lncRNAs with distinctive dysregulation of expression and copy number variation in HCC tumors compared with normal tissues. The results also suggest that the dysregulation of SNHG6 is highly cancer type specific. Through co-occurrence analyses, we found that SNHG6 and its related co-expressed genes on 8q are involved in the structural integrity of ribosome and translation. This comprehensive in silico analysis, provides a resource for investigating SNHG6 in hepatocellular carcinoma and lays the groundwork for design of next researches.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The integration of cyanide hydratase and tyrosinase catalysts enables effective degradation of cyanide and phenol in coking wastewaters The aim of this study was to design an effective method for the bioremediation of coking wastewaters, specifically for the concurrent elimination of their highly toxic components - cyanide and phenols. Almost full degradation of free cyanide (0.32-20 mM; 8.3-520 mg L(-1)) in the model and the real coking wastewaters was achieved by using a recombinant cyanide hydratase in the first step. The removal of cyanide, a strong inhibitor of tyrosinase, enabled an effective degradation of phenols by this enzyme in the second step. Phenol (16.5 mM, 1,552 mg L(-1)) was completely removed from a real coking wastewater within 20 h and cresols (5.0 mM, 540 mg L(-1)) were removed by 66% under the same conditions.

"Expressional divergence of insect GOX genes: From specialist to generalist glucose oxidase Insect herbivores often secrete glucose oxidase (GOX) onto plants to counteract plant defenses and potential pathogens. Whether generalist herbivores always have significantly higher GOX activities than their specialist counterparts at any comparable stage or conditions and how this is realized remain unknown. To address these two general questions, we subjected larvae of a pair of sister species differed mainly in host range, the generalist Helicoverpa armigera and its specialist counterpart Helicoverpa assulta, to the same sets of stage, protein to digestible carbohydrate (P:C) ratio, allelochemical or host plant treatments for simultaneous analyses of GOX transcripts and activities in their labial glands. GOX activity and transcripts are upregulated concurrently with food ingestion and body growth, downregulated with stopping ingestion and wandering for pupation in both species. The three tested host plants upregulated GOX transcripts, and to a lesser extent, GOX activity in both species. There were significant differences in both GOX transcripts and activity elicited by allelochemicals, but only in GOX transcripts by P:C ratios in both species. GOX activities were higher in H. armigera than H. assulta in all the comparable treatments, but GOX transcripts were significantly higher either in generalists or in specialists, depending on the developmental stages, host plants, P:C ratio and allelochemicals they encounter. These data indicate that the greater GOX activity in generalist herbivores is not achieved by greater transcription rate, but by greater transcript stability, greater translation rate, better enzyme stability and/or their combination.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Conditional reprogramming and long-term expansion of normal and tumor cells from human biospecimens Historically, it has been difficult to propagate cells in vitro that are derived directly from human tumors or healthy tissue. However, in vitro preclinical models are essential tools for both the study of basic cancer biology and the promotion of translational research, including drug discovery and drug target identification. This protocol describes conditional reprogramming (CR), which involves coculture of irradiated mouse fibroblast feeder cells with normal and tumor human epithelial cells in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632). CR cells can be used for various applications, including regenerative medicine, drug sensitivity testing, gene expression profiling and xenograft studies. The method requires a pathologist to differentiate healthy tissue from tumor tissue, and basic tissue culture skills. The protocol can be used with cells derived from both fresh and cryopreserved tissue samples. As approximately 1 million cells can be generated in 7 d, the technique is directly applicable to diagnostic and predictive medicine. Moreover, the epithelial cells can be propagated indefinitely in vitro, yet retain the capacity to become fully differentiated when placed into conditions that mimic their natural environment.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Melding a High-Risk Patient for Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device into a Low-Risk Patient The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been used as a predictor of mortality after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. However, improvement or worsening of MELD and how those changes affect outcomes is unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of 244 patients implanted with a continuous flow (CF) LVAD. Patients were dichotomized at admission into low - or high-risk categories using a cutoff of MELD â¥ 19, and they were reclassified at day of implant forming four groups: Group LL (remained low risk), LH (worsened to high risk), HH (remained high risk), and HL (improved to low risk). Patients who improved to a low risk (group HL) had the same 1 year survival as those that remained low risk (group LL; 80% vs. 77%; p = 0.6). However, patients who were initially classified as low risk and worsened to a high risk (group LH) had a survival that was worse than those that were consistently high risk (group HH; 55% vs. 10%; p = 0.01). Model for end-stage liver disease reclassification after adjusting for commonly attributed risk factors remained an independent predictor for mortality, including patients classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) 1 and 2. In conclusion, our MELD score reclassification is an independent and powerful predictor of mortality in patients undergoing LVAD implantation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"When traumatic event exposure characteristics matter: Impact of traumatic event exposure characteristics on posttraumatic and dissociative symptoms Traumatic events can lead to posttraumatic (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] specific symptoms) and dissociative symptoms (PTSD nonspecific symptoms). However, the trauma exposure characteristics (type of exposure, categorical form, number of exposures and the age of the exposure) are rarely studied. We hypothesized that the characteristics of a traumatic event are the only predictors of specific posttraumatic symptoms (intrusion, avoidance, negative cognitive impairment) and nonspecific symptoms (dissociation). We also hypothesized that some characteristics of a traumatic event are specific predictors of posttraumatic symptoms, whereas other characteristics are predictors of nonspecific symptoms. Three hundred nine university students participated in the study (201 men, 108 women; mean age: 19.32 years). Students completed questionnaires assessing trauma exposure characteristics, PTSD, dissociation, and burnout. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to identify predictive factors for elevated specific PTSD symptoms and elevated nonspecific PTSD symptoms. A different impact of the characteristics of 1 or more traumatic events was observed on specific posttraumatic symptoms. In men, the model was significant, with 6 predictors explaining 14% to 23% of the variance of specific posttraumatic symptoms. In women, 2 predictors explaining 15% to 28% of the variance of posttraumatic symptoms were found. The characteristics of the traumatic event were not the only predictors of posttraumatic symptoms (specific and nonspecific), with emotional exhaustion playing an unexpected predictive role. Burnout and PTSD might share emotional exhaustion as a common risk factor for PTSD. Further studies in this area are warranted, noteworthy focusing on clinical populations.

"An amperometric H2O2 biosensor based on hemoglobin nanoparticles immobilized onto a gold electrode The nanoparticles (NPs) of hemoglobin (Hb) were prepared by desolvation method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). An amperometric H2O2 biosensor was constructed by immobilizing Hb NPs covalently onto a polycrystalline Au electrode (Au E). Hb NPs / Au E was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) before and after immobilization of Hb NPs. The Hb NPs / Au electrode showed optimum response within 2.5s at pH 6.5 in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer containing 100Î¼M H2O2 and 30â°C, when operated at -0.2V against Ag/AgCl. The H bN Ps/ A uE exhibited Vmax of 5.161Â±0.1 Î¼A cm(-2) with Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 0.1Â±0.01mM. The biosensor showed lower detection limit (1.0Î¼M), high sensitivity (129Â±0.25Î¼A cm(-2) mM(-1)) and wider linear range (1.0-1200Î¼M) for H2O2 as compared to earlier biosensors. The analytical recoveries of added H2O2 in serum (0.5Î¼M and1.0Î¼M) were 97.77% and 98.01% respectively and within and between batch coefficients of variation (CV) were 3.16% and 3.36% respectively. There was a good correlation between sera H2O2 values obtained by standard enzymic colourimetric method and the present biosensor (R(2)=0.99). The biosensor measured H2O2 level in sera of apparently healthy subjects and persons suffering from diabetes type II. The Hb NPs / Au electrode lost 10% of its initial activity after 90 days of its regular uses, when stored dry at 4(o)C.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Colony Expansion of Socially Motile Myxococcus xanthus Cells Is Driven by Growth, Motility, and Exopolysaccharide Production Myxococcus xanthus, a model organism for studies of multicellular behavior in bacteria, moves exclusively on solid surfaces using two distinct but coordinated motility mechanisms. One of these, social (S) motility is powered by the extension and retraction of type IV pili and requires the presence of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by neighboring cells. As a result, S motility requires close cell-to-cell proximity and isolated cells do not translocate. Previous studies measuring S motility by observing the colony expansion of cells deposited on agar have shown that the expansion rate increases with initial cell density, but the biophysical mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. To understand the dynamics of S motility -driven colony expansion, we developed a reaction - diffusion model describing the effects of cell density, EPS deposition and nutrient exposure on the expansion rate. Our results show that at steady state the population expands as a traveling wave with a speed determined by the interplay of cell motility and growth, a well-known characteristic of Fisher's equation. The model explains the density - dependence of the colony expansion by demonstrating the presence of a lag phase -a transient period of very slow expansion with a duration dependent on the initial cell density. We propose that at a low initial density, more time is required for the cells to accumulate enough EPS to activate S-motility resulting in a longer lag period. Furthermore, our model makes the novel prediction that following the lag phase the population expands at a constant rate independent of the cell density. These predictions were confirmed by S motility experiments capturing long-term expansion dynamics.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Quantitative fetal fibronectin and cervical length to predict preterm birth in asymptomatic women with previous cervical surgery Quantitative fetal fibronectin testing has demonstrated accuracy for prediction of spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic women with a history of preterm birth. Predictive accuracy in women with previous cervical surgery (a potentially different risk mechanism) is not known. We sought to compare the predictive accuracy of cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin and cervical length testing in asymptomatic women with previous cervical surgery to that in women with 1 previous preterm birth. We conducted a prospective blinded secondary analysis of a larger observational study of cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin concentration in asymptomatic women measured with a Hologic 10Q system (Hologic, Marlborough, MA). Prediction of spontaneous preterm birth (<30, <34, and <37 weeks) with cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin concentration in primiparous women who had undergone at least 1 invasive cervical procedure (n = 473) was compared with prediction in women who had previous spontaneous preterm birth, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, or late miscarriage (n = 821). Relationship with cervical length was explored. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks in the cervical surgery group was 3% compared with 9% in previous spontaneous preterm birth group. Receiver operating characteristic curves comparing quantitative fetal fibronectin for prediction at all 3 gestational end points were comparable between the cervical surgery and previous spontaneous preterm birth groups (34 weeks: area under the curve, 0.78 [95% confidence interval 0.64-0.93] vs 0.71 [95% confidence interval 0.64-0.78]; P = .39). Prediction of spontaneous preterm birth using cervical length compared with quantitative fetal fibronectin for prediction of preterm birth <34 weeks of gestation offered similar prediction (area under the curve, 0.88 [95% confidence interval 0.79-0.96] vs 0.77 [95% confidence interval 0.62-0.92], P = .12 in the cervical surgery group; and 0.77 [95% confidence interval 0.70-0.84] vs 0.74 [95% confidence interval 0.67-0.81], P = .32 in the previous spontaneous preterm birth group). Prediction of spontaneous preterm birth using cervicovaginal fluid quantitative fetal fibronectin in asymptomatic women with cervical surgery is valid, and has comparative accuracy to that in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Epidemiology and outcomes of injuries in Kenya: A multisite surveillance study Injury is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, accounting for over 5 million deaths each year. The injury burden is higher in low- and middle-income countries where more than 90% of injury -related deaths occur. Despite this burden, the use of prospective trauma registries to describe injury epidemiology and outcomes is limited in low- and middle-income countries. Kenya lacks robust data to describe injury epidemiology and care. The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of injuries at 4 referral hospitals in Kenya using hospital -based trauma registries. From January 2014 to May 2015, all injured patients presenting to the casualty departments of Kenyatta National, Thika Level 5, Machakos Level 5, and Meru Level 5 Hospitals were enrolled prospectively. Data collected included demographic characteristics, type of prehospital care received, prehospital time, injury pattern, and outcomes. A total of 14,237 patients were enrolled in our study. Patients were predominantly male (76.1%) and young (mean age 28 years). The most common mechanisms of injury were road traffic injuries (36.8%), falls (26.4%), and being struck/hit by a person or object (20.1%). Burn was the most common mechanism of injury in the age category under 5 years. Body regions commonly injured were lower extremity (35.1%), upper extremity (33.4%), and head (26.0%). The overall mortality rate was 2.4%. Significant predictors of mortality from multivariate analysis were Glasgow Coma Scale â¤12, estimated injury severity score â¥9, burns, and gunshot injuries. Hospital -based trauma registries can be important sources of data to study the epidemiology of injuries in low- and middle-income countries. Data from such trauma registries can highlight key needs and be used to design public health interventions and quality-of-care improvement programs.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The course of cognitive functioning after first-episode of psychosis: A six month follow-up study Our aim with the present study was to evaluate rank-order and mean-level cognitive functioning stability among first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, measured using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), over a six month period. We also aimed to examine longitudinal measurement invariance and identify factors-such as age, gender, educational level, treatment and psychopathological change scores -potentially linked to cognitive change among patients. In addition, correlations between objectively measured and subjectively evaluated cognitive functioning were estimated. Neuropsychological assessments were administered to 85 patients after the initial stabilisation of their psychosis; 82 of the patients were retested. Subjectively perceived cognitive functioning was measured using a subscale derived from the Estonian version of the Subjective Well-Being Under Neuroleptic Scale (SWN-K-E). On average, executive functioning and processing speed improved significantly, while memory test scores decreased significantly, over time. Very high rank-order stability (r=0.80 to 0.94, p<0.001) was observed with all measured ability scores. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed the loadings of a single (broad ability) factor model were equal across both measurement occasions, but the lack of intercept invariance suggested that mean -level comparisons are more appropriately carried out at a subtest level. On average psychopathology scores and antipsychotics doses declined over time, with the latter also significantly correlating with better executive functioning. Gender was a significant moderator of some domains of cognitive performance, and decline tended to be somewhat more pronounced for women. The results also indicated the lack of any relationship between objective and subjective measurements of cognitive functioning.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) rs2066853 gene polymorphism association with infertile oligoasthenoteratozoospermic men and seminal oxidative stress This study aimed to assess the association between aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) rs2066853 gene polymorphism with infertile oligoasthenoteratozoospermic (OAT) men and seminal oxidative stress (OS). A total of 170 Egyptian men were allocated according to their semen analysis into fertile normozoospermic controls (n = 50) and infertile OAT men (n = 120). They were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, semen analysis, estimation of seminal glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). AhR rs2066853 gene polymorphism was identified in the blood by PCR - RFLP. Comparing infertile OAT men with fertile controls, AhR rs2066853 genotypes showed decreased prevalence for wild homozygous genotype GG (35.8 vs 56%) and for heterozygous genotype GA (17.5 vs 30%) and an increased prevalence for homozygous genotype AA (46.7 vs 14%). Distribution of alleles of AhR rs2066853 among OAT men compared with fertile men showed decreased prevalence of G allele (44.6 vs 71%) and an increased prevalence of A allele (55.4 vs 29%). Seminal MDA demonstrated significant increase whereas seminal GPx demonstrated significant decrease in cases with AA and GA / AA genotypes compared to cases with GG genotype. It is concluded that there is a significant association between AhR rs2066853 genotype polymorphism with decreased sperm parameters as well as increased seminal oxidative stress in infertile OAT men.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Undisclosed HIV infection and art use in the kenya AIDS indicator survey 2012: relevance to targets for HIV diagnosis and treatment in kenya To assess the impact of undisclosed HIV infection and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) on national estimates of diagnosed HIV and ART coverage in Kenya. HIV-positive dried blood spot samples from Kenya's second AIDS Indicator Survey were tested for an ARV biomarker by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Estimates of diagnosed HIV and ART use based on self-report were compared with those corrected for undisclosed HIV infection and ART use based on ARV testing. Multivariate analysis determined factors associated with undisclosed HIV infection and ART use among persons on ART. Among 559 HIV-positive samples, the ARV biomarker was detected in 42.5% (CI 37.4-47.7). ARV drugs were present in 90.7% (CI 86.1-95.2) reporting HIV-positive status and receiving ART, 66.7% (CI 59.9-73.4) reporting HIV-positive status irrespective of ART use, 21.0% (CI 13.4-28.6) reporting HIV-negative status, and 19.3% (CI 9.0-29.5) reporting no previous HIV test. After correcting for undisclosed HIV infection and ART use, diagnosed HIV increased from 46.9% to 57.2% and ART coverage increased from 31.8% to 42.8%. Undisclosed HIV infection on ART was associated with being aged 25-39 years and not visiting a health provider in the past year, while younger age and higher wealth was associated with undisclosed ART use. Substantial levels of undisclosed HIV infection and ART use while on ART were observed, resulting in diagnosed HIV underestimated by 112,000 persons and ART coverage by 131,000 persons. Supplementing self-reported ART status with objective measures of ART use in national population -based sero-surveys can improve monitoring of treatment targets in countries.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Activation of ephrinB-EphB receptor signalling in rat spinal cord contributes to maintenance of diabetic neuropathic pain Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is severe and intractable in clinic. The specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying DNP remain elusive and its treatment are limited. We investigated roles of EphB1 receptor in the development of DNP. Diabetic neuropathic pain was produced in male, adult, Sprague-Dawley rats by a single i.p. streptozotocin (STZ) or alloxan. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to analyse expression of EphB1 receptor as well as the activation of the glial cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord. DNP manifested as mechanical allodynia, which was determined by measuring incidence of foot withdrawal in response to mechanical indentation of the hind paw by an electro von Frey filament. Diabetic neuropathic pain and high blood glucose were exhibited simultaneously in around 70% of animals that received i.p. STZ or alloxan. Phosphorylation of EphB1, activation of the astrocytes and microglial cells, and level of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interleukin (IL)-1Î² in the spinal cord were significantly increased in rats with DNP. Spinal blocking EphB1 receptor activation in the late phase after STZ injection significantly suppressed the established mechanical allodynia as well as activation of the astrocytes and microglial cells and activity of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î². However, spinal treatment of EphB1 - Fc in the early phase after STZ injection did not prevent the induction of DNP. EphB1 receptor activation in the spinal cord is critical to the maintenance, but not induction of diabetic pain. EphB1 receptor may be a potential target for relieving the established diabetic pain. Activation of EphB1 receptor in the spinal cord is critical to maintaining the established diabetic neuropathic pain, but not to diabetic pain induction. Spinal blocking EphB1 receptor activation suppresses ongoing diabetic neuropathic pain.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The NCAM1 gene set is linked to depressive symptoms and their brain structural correlates in healthy individuals Depressive symptoms exist on a continuum, the far end of which is found in depressive disorders. Utilizing the continuous spectrum of depressive symptoms may therefore contribute to the understanding of the biological underpinnings of depression. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an important tool for the identification of gene groups linked to complex traits, and was applied in the present study on genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of depression scores and their brain-level structural correlates in healthy young individuals. On symptom level (i.e. depression scores), robust enrichment was identified for two gene sets: NCAM1 Interactions and Collagen Formation. Depression scores were also associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) - a brain white matter property - within the forceps minor and the left superior temporal longitudinal fasciculus. Within each of these tracts, mean FA value of depression score - associated voxels was used as a phenotype in a subsequent GSEA. The NCAM1 Interactions gene set was significantly enriched in these tracts.

"The Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Migraine in Primary Care Chronic migraine is common, affecting approximately 1% of the general population, and causes significant disability. To summarize optimal involvement of primary care physicians in chronic migraine care, and to provide algorithms to assist them in the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic migraine. An analysis of diagnostic and treatment needs in chronic migraine, based on a synthesis of the medical literature and clinical experience. Chronic migraine represents the more severe end of the migraine spectrum, usually arises out of previous episodic migraine, and is characterized by headache on 15 days a month or more. Importantly, the headache needs to meet migraine diagnostic criteria on only 8 days a month in order to meet chronic migraine diagnostic criteria. When acute medication overuse is present, a second diagnosis of medication overuse headache should be made. If patients meet criteria for chronic migraine, this excludes a diagnosis of chronic tension-type headache. Acute therapy of chronic migraine is similar to episodic migraine, except that medication overuse is a much greater risk in chronic migraine and must be addressed. All patients should be considered for pharmacological prophylaxis, and the behavioral aspects of therapy should be emphasized. The two prophylactic drugs with the best evidence for efficacy in chronic migraine are topiramate and onabotulinumtoxinA. Given the disability caused by chronic migraine, these should both be available to patients as necessary. Management of chronic migraine is complex, and many patients are relatively refractory to therapy. Specialist referral will often be required and should not be unduly delayed. On the other hand, the primary care physician should be able to make the diagnosis, initiate therapy, and manage some less refractory patients without referral. The timing of referral should depend both on the expertise of the primary care physician in headache management and the patient's response to initial therapy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Prostate-specific antigen increase during dutasteride to indicate the need for prostate biopsy: influence of prostatic inflammation The aim of this study was to analyze the significance of an increase in total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum levels despite dutasteride treatment as a predictor of prostate cancer (PC) at biopsy. We focused our attention on the rate of the first PSA increase and on the influence of prostatic inflammation. From 2011 to 2016, 365 men with a previous negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated PSA levels received dutasteride treatment. The population was followed for a range of 12-48 months. One hundred twelve cases with a confirmed PSA increase >0.5 ng/ml over the nadir value during the follow-up were included in Group A and underwent a new prostate biopsy. In Group A, the PSA increase was associated with PC at the re-biopsy in 66% of cases. The percentage of PSA reduction after 6 months of treatment was not a significant indicator of the risk for PC. The distribution of inflammatory infiltrates significantly (p<00.01) varied from positive to negative prostate biopsies. The relative risk for PC at biopsy significantly increase d according to PSA level during dutasteride. Treatment with dutasteride can help to analyze PSA kinetic. A persistent prostatic inflammation is a factor able to reduce the performance of PSA kinetic during dutasteride treatment.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Phenozan, a Synthetic Phenolic Antioxidant, Inhibits the Development of Spontaneous Tumors in Rats and Mice Synthetic phenolic antioxidant Î²-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl) propionic acid, named phenozan, is a potential antiepileptic drug. In pre-clinical trials this substance did not manifest any toxicity, and also inhibited the development of some spontaneous tumors in animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate inhibiting effect of phenozan on spontaneous carcinogenesis in rats and mice. In experiments with rats LIO and mice SHR of local breeding, with high spontaneous tumor incidence, phenozan was dissolved in sunflower oil and administered by gavage in therapeutic dose 5 mg/kg 3 times per week for 18 months. There were no any signs of toxicity and differences in weight of animals during the phenozan treatment compared with the control (sunflower oil). Phenozan significantly reduced the overall incidence and multiplicity of all tumors but only multiplicity of malignant tumors, compared with the control. Moreover a significant decrease of overall incidence and multiplicity was observed in pituitary and breast tumors in females and only overall multiplicity of tumors of pituitary and lymphoid tissue in males. In mice phenozan reduced overall incidence and multiplicity of lung tumors (in females) and also overall multiplicity of all tumors (in females) and only malignant tumors (in males). These findings allow us to classify phenozan as anticarcinogenic agent. Anticarcinogenic activity of phenozan is important because clinical study of this drug as the possible antiepileptic drug goes along and it is known that such drugs are designed for long-term use.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Identification and SAR Evaluation of Hemozoin - Inhibiting Benzamides Active against Plasmodium falciparum Quinoline antimalarials target hemozoin formation causing a cytotoxic accumulation of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (Fe(III)PPIX). Well-developed SAR models exist for Î²-hematin inhibition, parasite activity, and cellular mechanisms for this compound class, but no comparably detailed investigations exist for other hemozoin inhibiting chemotypes. Here, benzamide analogues based on previous HTS hits have been purchased or synthesized. Only derivatives containing an electron deficient aromatic ring and capable of adopting flat conformations, optimal for Ï-Ï interactions with Fe(III)PPIX, inhibited Î²-hematin formation. The two most potent analogues showed nanomolar parasite activity, with little CQ cross-resistance, low cytotoxicity, and high in vitro microsomal stability. Selected analogues inhibited hemozoin formation in Plasmodium falciparum causing high levels of free heme. In contrast to quinolines, introduction of amine side chains did not lead to benzamide accumulation in the parasite. These data reveal complex relationships between heme binding, free heme levels, cellular accumulation, and in vitro activity of potential novel antimalarials.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Adenosine arrests breast cancer cell motility by A3 receptor stimulation In neutrophils, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release and autocrine purinergic signaling regulate coordinated cell motility during chemotaxis. Here, we studied whether similar mechanisms regulate the motility of breast cancer cells. While neutrophils and benign human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) form a single leading edge, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells possess multiple leading edges enriched with A3 adenosine receptors. Compared to HMEC, MDA-MB-231 cells overexpress the ectonucleotidases ENPP1 and CD73, which convert extracellular ATP released by the cells to adenosine that stimulates A3 receptors and promotes cell migration with frequent directional changes. However, exogenous adenosine added to breast cancer cells or the A3 receptor agonist IB-MECA dose - dependently arrested cell motility by simultaneous stimulation of multiple leading edges, doubling cell surface areas and significantly reducing migration velocity by up to 75 %. We conclude that MDA-MB-231 cells, HMEC, and neutrophils differ in the purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate their motility patterns and that the subcellular distribution of A3 adenosine receptors in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells contributes to dysfunctional cell motility. These findings imply that purinergic signaling mechanisms may be potential therapeutic targets to interfere with the motility of breast cancer cells in order to reduce the spread of cancer cells and the risk of metastasis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Consecutive non-natural PZ nucleobase pairs in DNA impact helical structure as seen in 50 Î¼s molecular dynamics simulations Little is known about the influence of multiple consecutive ' non-standard ' (, 6-amino-5-nitro-2(1H)-pyridone, and, 2-amino-imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4(8H)-one) nucleobase pairs on the structural parameters of duplex DNA. nucleobase pairs follow standard rules for Watson-Crick base pairing but have rearranged hydrogen bonding donor and acceptor groups. Using the X-ray crystal structure as a starting point, we have modeled the motions of a DNA duplex built from a self-complementary oligonucleotide (5Î-CTTATPPPZZZATAAG-3Î) in water over a period of 50 Î¼s and calculated DNA local parameters, step parameters, helix parameters, and major / minor groove widths to examine how the presence of multiple, consecutive nucleobase pairs might impact helical structure. In these simulations, the - containing DNA duplex exhibits a significantly wider major groove and greater average values of stagger, slide, rise, twist and h-rise than observed for a ' control ' oligonucleotide in which nucleobase pairs are replaced by. The molecular origins of these structural changes are likely associated with at least two differences between and. First, the electrostatic properties of differ from in terms of density distribution and dipole moment.

"An Improved Culture Method for Selective Isolation of Campylobacter jejuni from Wastewater Campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading foodborne pathogens worldwide. C. jejuni is isolated from a wide range of foods, domestic animals, wildlife, and environmental sources. The currently available culture-based isolation methods are not highly effective for wastewater samples due to the low number of C. jejuni in the midst of competing bacteria. To detect and isolate C. jejuni from wastewater samples, in this study, we evaluated a few different enrichment conditions using five different antibiotics (i.e., cefoperazone, vancomycin, trimethoprim, polymyxin B, and rifampicin), to which C. jejuni is intrinsically resistant. The selectivity of each enrichment condition was measured with C t value using quantitative real-time PCR, and multiplex PCR to determine Campylobacter species. In addition, the efficacy of Campylobacter isolation on different culture media after selective enrichment was examined by growing on Bolton and Preston agar plates. The addition of polymyxin B, rifampicin, or both to the Bolton selective supplements enhanced the selective isolation of C. jejuni. The results of 16S rDNA sequencing also revealed that Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major competing bacteria in the enrichment conditions. Although it is known to be difficult to isolate Campylobacter from samples with heavy contamination, this study well exhibited that the manipulation of antibiotic selective pressure improves the isolation efficiency of fastidious Campylobacter from wastewater.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Neurological Decline in an Elderly with Repaired Myelomeningocele Complicated with Lumbar Canal Stenosis: a case report Tethered cord syndrome is a well-known complication after myelomeningocele (MMC) repair in childhood. However, late complications in adults with a repaired MMC are not well understood. In particular, the influence of a degenerative spinal deformity on a sustained tethered cord is still unclear. A 63-year-old man with a repaired MMC presented with a progressive gait disturbance and numbness in both lower limbs. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated that the tethered spinal cord was compressed by severe canal stenosis along the entire lumbar spine. After a multi-level lumbar decompression surgery, the patient recovered to baseline neurological status. In adults with a repaired MMC, lumbar canal stenosis should be investigated as a possible cause of late neurological decline. Clinical manifestations may be complicated by the coexistence of both the original and subsequent neurological disorders. Because these additional disorders result from compressive myelopathy, early surgical decompression is indicated to avoid irreversible spinal cord dysfunction.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"E3 Ligase RNF126 Directly Ubiquitinates Frataxin, Promoting Its Degradation: Identification of a Potential Therapeutic Target for Friedreich Ataxia Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a severe genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. To date, there is no therapy to treat this condition. The amount of residual frataxin critically affects the severity of the disease; thus, attempts to restore physiological frataxin levels are considered therapeutically relevant. Frataxin levels are controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; therefore, inhibition of the frataxin E3 ligase may represent a strategy to achieve an increase in frataxin levels. Here, we report the identification of the RING E3 ligase RNF126 as the enzyme that specifically mediates frataxin ubiquitination and targets it for degradation. RNF126 interacts with frataxin and promotes its ubiquitination in a catalytic activity - dependent manner, both in vivo and in vitro. Most importantly, RNF126 depletion results in frataxin accumulation in cells derived from FRDA patients, highlighting the relevance of RNF126 as a new therapeutic target for Friedreich ataxia.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Pentraxin 3 in neonates with and without diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension Pentraxin 3 is a novel biomarker produced by vascular endothelial cells and macrophages. In recent studies involving adults, pentraxin 3 has been introduced as a reliable biomarker in the evaluation of cardiovascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. This study was conducted with an aim to measure the level of pentraxin 3 in neonates with pulmonary hypertension and comparing with normal healthy controls. In a case-control study, plasma pentraxin 3 levels were evaluated in 3 groups of neonates including neonates with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), neonates with congenital heart disease without pulmonary arterial hypertension (CHD-PAH) and normal healthy neonates. Plasma pentraxin 3 levels in 72 neonates (21 in PAH, 19 in CHD-PAH, and 32 in control group) were measured. Demographic characteristics had no significant statistical difference among the 3 groups. Pentraxin 3 levels in PAH group was significantly higher than CHD-PAH and control groups (2.12Â±2.32 vs. 0.58Â±0.57 and 1.03Â±1.38ng/mL, P=0.008, respectively). No significant correlation was found between concentrations of pentraxin 3 and cardiac ejection fractions between PAH and CHD-PAH (r=0.009, P=0.97). However, significant positive correlation was detected between PTX3 concentrations and pulmonary pressures between these two groups (r=0.499, P=0.001). Results from our study showed that pentraxin 3 levels were increased in newborn infants with pulmonary hypertension. Plasma pentraxin 3 could be considered as a novel adjunct diagnostic tool in the evaluation of pulmonary hypertension in combination with echocardiography or as a diagnostic tool when echocardiography is not readily available for confirmation of increased pulmonary pressure.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Arthrobacter ginkgonis sp. nov., an actinomycete isolated from rhizosphere of Ginkgo biloba L A Gram-stain-positive, aerobic actinobacterial strain (designated SYP-A7299T), which displayed a rod-coccus growth lifecycle, was isolated from the rhizosphere of Ginkgo biloba L. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain SYP-A7299T belongs to the genus Arthrobacter and is most closely related to Arthrobacter halodurans JSM 078085T (97.4 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The DNA - DNA relatedness value between strain SYP-A7299T and A. halodurans JSM 078085T was 37 % Â±2.9. The cell-wall peptidoglycan was A4Î±, and glucose and galactose were whole-cell sugars. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two glycolipids and an unknown polar lipid. The major menaquinone were MK-8(H2) (72 %) and MK-9(H2) (28 %), and the predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15: 0, iso-C15: 0 and anteiso-C17: 0. The DNA G+C content was 68.9 mol%. Based on the morphological, physiological, biochemical and chemotaxonomic characters presented in this study, strain SYP-A7299T represents a novel species of the genus Arthrobacter, for which the name Arthrobacter ginkgonis sp. nov. is proposed.

"Crystal Structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ECM4, a Xi-Class Glutathione Transferase that Reacts with Glutathionyl-(hydro)quinones Glutathionyl-hydroquinone reductases (GHRs) belong to the recently characterized Xi-class of glutathione transferases (GSTXs) according to unique structural properties and are present in all but animal kingdoms. The GHR ScECM4 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied since 1997 when it was found to be potentially involved in cell-wall biosynthesis. Up to now and in spite of biological studies made on this enzyme, its physiological role remains challenging. The work here reports its crystallographic study. In addition to exhibiting the general GSTX structural features, ScECM4 shows extensions including a huge loop which contributes to the quaternary assembly. These structural extensions are probably specific to Saccharomycetaceae. Soaking of ScECM4 crystals with GS-menadione results in a structure where glutathione forms a mixed disulfide bond with the cysteine 46. Solution studies confirm that ScECM4 has reductase activity for GS-menadione in presence of glutathione. Moreover, the high resolution structures allowed us to propose new roles of conserved residues of the active site to assist the cysteine 46 during the catalytic act.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stepwise cyclopropanation on the polycyclopropanated polyketide formation in jawsamycin biosynthesis Jawsamycin is a polyketide - nucleoside hybrid with a unique polycyclopropane moiety on a single polyketide chain.

"Patterns of coronary plaque progression: phasic versus gradual. A combined optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound study Some plaques grow slowly in a linear manner, whereas others undergo a rapid phasic progression. However, the detailed in-vivo relationship between plaque characteristics and plaque progression pattern has not been reported. The current study aimed to investigate the plaque progression patterns with serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examinations, and to correlate baseline plaque characteristics assessed by optical coherence tomography and IVUS with plaque progression patterns. A total of 248 coronary lesions from 157 patients were identified and imaged by both optical coherence tomography and IVUS at baseline. IVUS examination was repeated at 6 and 12 months. Plaque progression was defined as greater than or equal to 5% increase in percent atheroma volume by IVUS. The progression patterns were divided into three groups: no progression, rapid phasic progression, and gradual progression. Among 248 lesions, 190 (77%) showed no progression. Among 58 lesions with progression, 20 (34%) showed gradual progression, whereas 38 (66%) showed rapid phasic progression. Multivariate analysis indicated that thin-cap fibroatheroma [odds ratio (OR)=5.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.04-13.4; P=0.001], microvessel (OR =2.20, 95% CI 1.10-4.79; P=0.045), and positive remodeling (OR =2.64, 95% CI 1.19-5.81; P=0.016) were associated independently with rapid phasic progression. Three-quarters of coronary plaques did not progress over time with contemporary medical treatment. Among the lesions with progression, one-third showed a gradual pattern and two-thirds showed a rapid phasic pattern. The presence of thin-cap fibroatheroma, microvessel, and positive remodeling were the independent predictors for rapid phasic pattern progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaques.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Curcumin synergistically increases effects of Î²-interferon and retinoic acid on breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by up-regulation of GRIM-19 through STAT3 - dependent and STAT3 - independent pathways The study aimed to investigate the effects of combination treatment of curcumin and Î²-interferon (IFN-Î²)/ retinoic acid (RA) on breast cancer cells, including cell viability, apoptosis and migration, and to determine the mechanisms related to GRIM-19 through STAT3 - dependent and STAT3 - independent pathways. The following groups were used for the in vitro experiment: control siRNA, GRIM-19 siRNA, IFN-Î² / RA and IFN-Î² / RA + curcumin. Cell viability is by the MTT method, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry and cell migration by wound healing experiment; GRIM-19, STAT3, survivin, Bcl-2, GADD153 and COX-2 expression was measured by Western blot. In vivo experiment, MCF-7 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. GRIM-19 siRNA promoted MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration; inhibited cell apoptosis; and promoted the expression of STAT3, survivin, Bcl-2 and MMP-9. IFN-Î² / RA inhibited cell proliferation and migration; promoted cell apoptosis; up-regulated GRIM-19; and inhibited the expression of STAT3, survivin, Bcl-2 and MMP-9. Combination treatment of curcumin and IFN-Î² / RA had a stronger effect than that of the IFN-Î² / RA group. In addition, curcumin and IFN-Î² / RA combination inhibited the expression of COX-2 and up-regulated GADD153. Curcumin synergistically increases the effects of IFN-Î² / RA on breast cancer cells. The mechanism may be related to the up-regulation of GRIM-19 through STAT3 - dependent and STAT3 - independent pathways.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"TANGO - a screening tool to identify comorbidities on the causal pathway of nocturia To develop a robust screening metric for use in identifying non-lower urinary tract comorbidities pertinent to the multidisciplinary assessment of patients with nocturia. Variables having a significant risk association with nocturia of greater than once per night were identified. Discriminating items from validated and reliable tools measuring these comorbidities were identified. A self-completed 57-item questionnaire was developed and a medical checklist and pertinent clinical measures added. Pre-determined criteria were applied to retain or remove items in the development of the Short-Form (SF) screening tool. The tool was administered to 252 individuals with nocturia who were attending either a tertiary level Sleep, Continence, Falls or Rehabilitation service for routine care. Data collected were subjected to descriptive analysis; criteria were applied to reduce the number of items. Using pre-determined domains, a nocturia screening metric, entitled TANGO, was generated. The acronym TANGO stands for Targeting the individual's Aetiology of Nocturia to Guide Outcomes. The demographic characteristics of the sample are described, along with item endorsement levels. The statistical and structural framework to justify deleting or retaining of items from the TANGO Long-Form to the SF is presented. The resultant TANGO - SF patient -completed nocturia screening tool is reported. A novel all-cause diagnostic metric for identifying co-existing morbidities of clinical relevance to nocturia in patients who present across disciplines and medical specialties has been developed. TANGO has the potential to improve practice and smooth inequalities associated with a siloed approach to assessment and subsequent care of patients with nocturia.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Attenuation of High Glucose - Induced Rat Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis by Exendin-4 via Intervention of HO-1 / Nrf-2 and the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway Exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, demonstrated cytoprotective actions beyond glycemic control in recent studies. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of exendin-4 on high glucose (HG)- induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the possible mechanisms. Rat cardiomyocytes were divided into 3 groups: normal glucose group (NG group), HG group and HG + exendin-4 group (HG + Ex Group). Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was evaluated by double-staining with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/ propidium iodide (PI) and flow cytometry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by 2â,7â-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) incubation and fluorescence microscopy. LY294002 (LY), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitor, was added to the medium of the HG + Ex + LY Group for further western blot analysis. The proteins analyzed involved oxidative stress - associated proteins, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), and apoptosis - associated proteins, caspase-3, Bax/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and p-AKT / AKT. HG treatment induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.00) and clearly upregulated ROS production (P = 0.00); exendin-4 co-incubation also ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P = 0.004) and decreased ROS (P = 0.00) level significantly. HO-1 and Nrf-2 protein expression levels decreased significantly in the HG group (P < 0.05), but the levels were elevated by exendin-4 intervention (P < 0.05). Furthermore, exendin-4 attenuated HG - induced higher protein expression, including cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, increased the expression of Bcl-2 protein (P < 0.05). However, these impacts of exendin-4 were counteracted significantly by co-incubation with LY294002. In addition, exendin-4 ameliorated HG - induced p-AKT / AKT lower expression, and this impact was also suppressed by LY294002. Exendin-4 ameliorates HG - induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and the mechanisms may involve anti-oxidative stress via the HO-1 / Nrf-2 system, as well as intervention of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Longitudinal study of bovine rotavirus group A in newborn calves from vaccinated and unvaccinated dairy herds Reports of rotavirus excretion in calves usually result from cross-sectional studies, and in face of the conflicting results regarding protection of calves born to vaccinated dams against diarrhea, the aim of the present study was to evaluate rotavirus excretion in dairy calves born to vaccinated or unvaccinated dams, to identify the genotypes of bovine rotavirus group A (RVA) strains isolated from these animals as well as to investigate characteristics of the disease in naturally occurring circumstances throughout the first month of life. Five hundred fifty-two fecal samples were taken from 56 calves, 28 from each farm and, in the vaccinated herd, 11/281 samples (3.91%) taken from six different calves tested positive for RVA while in the unvaccinated herd, 3/271 samples (1.11%) taken from 3 different calves tested positive. The genotyping of the VP7 genes showed 91.2% nucleotide sequence identity to G6 genotype (NCDV strain), and for the VP4 gene, strains from the vaccinated herd were 96.6% related to B223 strain, while strains from the unvaccinated herd were 88% related to P[5] genotype (UK strain). Genotypes found in this study were G6P[11] in the vaccinated herd and G6P[5] in the unvaccinated herd. All calves infected with rotavirus presented an episode of diarrhea in the first month of life, and the discrepancy between the genotypes found in the commercial vaccine (G6P[1] and G10P[11]) and the rotavirus strains circulating in both vaccinated and unvaccinated herds show the importance of keeping constant surveillance in order to avoid potential causes of vaccination failure.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Phylogeography of the Spanish Moon Moth Graellsia isabellae (Lepidoptera, Saturniidae) Geographic and demographic factors as well as specialisation to a new host-plant may lead to host - associated differentiation in plant -feeding insects. We explored the phylogeography of a protected moth, Graellsia isabellae, and its two recognised host-plant species (Pinus sylvestris and P. nigra) in order to seek for any concordance useful to disentangle the evolutionary history of this iconic lepidopteran. DNA variation in one mitochondrial marker and nine nuclear microsatellite loci revealed a strong phylogeographic pattern across 28 populations of G. isabellae studied in Spain and France comprising six groups mostly distributed along different mountain ranges. Reanalysis of a previously published chloroplast microsatellite dataset revealed a three and two- group structure for Spanish P. sylvestris and P. nigra, respectively. Overall, the population groupings of this protected moth did not match the ones of P. sylvestris and P. nigra. There was no evidence of host - associated differentiation between populations using P. sylvestris and the ones inhabiting P. nigra. The two major mitochondrial clades of G. isabellae likely diverged before the Last Glacial Maximum and geographically separated the species into a "" southern "" (Central and Southern Iberian clusters) and a "" northern "" lineage (Eastern Iberian, Pyrenean and French Alpine clusters). The Eastern Iberian System, where this insect uses both host-plants, harboured the highest level of genetic diversity. Such a group independently colonised the West and East parts of the Pyrenees. Our results point to a native origin for the French populations occurring in the Alps, genetically related to the Eastern Iberian and Pyrenean sites. The Central Iberian group derived from Southern Iberian ancestors. Secondary contacts were inferred between the Southern/Central Iberian populations and Eastern Iberian cluster as well as between the two Pyrenean ones. The mito-nuclear discordance observed with regard to the Eastern Iberian cluster is congruent with a secondary contact after the evolution of mito-nuclear incompatibilities in geographically isolated areas.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"How Should I Study for the Exam? Self-Regulated Learning Strategies and Achievement in Introductory Biology In college introductory science courses, students are challenged with mastering large amounts of disciplinary content while developing as autonomous and effective learners. Self-regulated learning (SRL) is the process of setting learning goals, monitoring progress toward them, and applying appropriate study strategies. SRL characterizes successful, ""expert"" learners, and develops with time and practice. In a large, undergraduate introductory biology course, we investigated: 1) what SRL strategies students reported using the most when studying for exams, 2) which strategies were associated with higher achievement and with grade improvement on exams, and 3) what study approaches students proposed to use for future exams. Higher - achieving students, and students whose exam grades improved in the first half of the semester, reported using specific cognitive and metacognitive strategies significantly more frequently than their lower - achieving peers. Lower - achieving students more frequently reported that they did not implement their planned strategies or, if they did, still did not improve their outcomes. These results suggest that many students entering introductory biology have limited knowledge of SRL strategies and/or limited ability to implement them, which can impact their achievement. Course -specific interventions that promote SRL development should be considered as integral pedagogical tools, aimed at fostering development of students ' lifelong learning skills.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Pedicle Screw Combined With Lateral Mass Screw Fixation in the Treatment of Basilar Invagination and Congenital C2-C3 Fusion Clinical evaluation of a surgical fixation technique featuring combined use of pedicle screw and lateral mass screw (LMS). Introduction of a novel technique for the treatment of congenital C2-C3 fusion and basilar invagination (BI). Posterior occipitocervical fixation using C2 pedicle screw was widely used for BI. However, in cases where BI is concurrent with congenital C2-C3 fusion, the C2 pedicles tend to be thinner than that in normal population and hence more likely to fail. We prompted to tackle the issue by combining the pedicle screw with the additional use of LMS in attempt to strengthen the fixation. Twenty-five patients who underwent combined pedicle screw with LMS fixation were retrospectively studied. The instrument position, fusion status, and complications were analyzed. None had spinal cord or vertebral artery injury. The average follow-up time was 20 months. Solid fusion was achieved in 23 patients (92%) as detected radiologically. Two cases suffered from recurred BI and instrument failure but eventually achieved solid fusion between the occiput and C2 was after revision. Among all 25 patients, 4 suffered from complications including instrument s failure, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and intracranial infection. The clinical outcome indicates that the technique is reliable for the treatment of BI with congenital C2-C3 fusion.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A height-for-age growth reference for children with achondroplasia: Expanded applications and comparison with original reference data The height-for-age (HA) reference currently used for children with achondroplasia is not adaptable for electronic records or calculation of HA Z-scores. We report new HA curves and tables of mean and standard deviation (SD) HA, for calculating Z-scores, from birth -16 years in achondroplasia. Mixed longitudinal data were abstracted from medical records of achondroplasia patients from a single clinical practice (CIS, 1967-2004). Gender-specific height percentiles (5, 25, 50, 75, 95th) were estimated across the age continuum, using a 2 month window per time point smoothed by a quadratic smoothing algorithm. HA curves were constructed for 0-36 months and 2-16 years to optimize resolution for younger children. Mean monthly height (SD) was tabulated. These novel HA curves were compared to reference data currently in use for children with achondroplasia. 293 subjects (162 male /131 female) contributed 1,005 and 932 height measures, with greater data paucity with age. Mean HA tracked with original achondroplasia norms, particularly through mid-childhood (2-9 years), but with no evidence of a pubertal growth spurt. Standard deviation of height at each month interval increased from birth through 16 years. Birth length was lower in achondroplasia than average stature and, as expected, height deficits increased with age. A new HA reference is available for longitudinal growth assessment in achondroplasia, taking advantage of statistical modeling techniques and allowing for Z-score calculations. This is an important contribution to clinical care and research endeavors for the achondroplasia population.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Extracellular vesicles from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells protect against murine hepatic ischemia - reperfusion injury Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and associated inflammation contributes to liver dysfunction and complications after liver surgery and transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been reported to reduce hepatic IRI because of their reparative immunomodulatory effects in injured tissues. Recent studies have highlighted beneficial effects of extracellular vesicles from MSCs (MSC - EV) on tissue injury. The effects of systemically administered mouse bone marrow derived MSC - EV were evaluated in an experimental murine model of hepatic IRI induced by cross clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein for 90 minutes followed by reperfusion for periods of upto 6 hours. Compared with controls, intravenous administration of MSC - EV 30 minutes prior to IRI dramatically reduced the extent of tissue necrosis, decreased caspase-3 positive and apoptotic cells, and reduced serum aminotransferase levels. MSC - EV increased hepatic mRNA expression of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 12 (Nlrp12), and the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and reduced mRNA expression of several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 during IRI. MSC - EV increased cell viability and suppressed both oxidative injury and NF-ÎºB activity in AML12 murine hepatocytes in vitro. In conclusion, the administration of EV derived from bone marrow derived MSCs may ameliorate hepatic IRI by reducing hepatic injury through modulation of the inflammatory response.

"CDK5 inhibitors prevent astroglial apoptosis and reactive astrogliosis by regulating PKA and DRP1 phosphorylations in the rat hippocampus Status epilepticus (SE) results in the unique pattern of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial dynamics, which is associated with astroglial apoptosis and reactive astrogliosis in the regional - specific pattern representing the differential astroglial properties. However, less defined are the epiphenomena / upstream effecters for DRP1 phosphorylation in this process. Since cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is involved in reactive astrogliosis, CDK5 is one of the possible upstream regulators for DRP1 phosphorylation. In the present study, both olomoucine and roscovitine (CDK5 inhibitors) effectively ameliorated SE - induced astroglial apoptosis in the dentate gyrus without changed seizure susceptibility. In addition, they inhibited reactive astrogliosis in the CA1 region independent of neuronal death induced by SE. These effects of CDK5 inhibitors were relevant to abrogation of altered DRP1 phosphorylation ratio and mitochondrial length induced by SE. CDK5 inhibitors also negatively regulated protein kinase A (PKA) activity in astrocytes. Therefore, our findings suggest that CDK5 inhibitors may mitigate astroglial apoptosis and reactive astrogliosis accompanied by modulations of DRP1 -mediated mitochondrial dynamics.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Sleep characteristics in type 1 diabetes and associations with glycemic control: systematic review and meta-analysis The association between inadequate sleep and type 2 diabetes has garnered much attention, but little is known about sleep and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our objectives were to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing sleep in persons with and without T1D, and to explore relationships between sleep and glycemic control in T1D. Studies were identified from Medline and Scopus. Studies reporting measures of sleep in T1D patients and controls, and/or associations between sleep and glycemic control, were selected. A total of 22 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. Children with T1D had shorter sleep duration (mean difference [MD] = -26.4 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -35.4, -17.7) than controls. Adults with T1D reported poorer sleep quality (MD in standardized sleep quality score = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.70), with higher scores reflecting worse sleep quality) than controls, but there was no difference in self - reported sleep duration. Adults with TID who reported sleeping >6 hours had lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels than those sleeping â¤6 hours (MD = -0.24%; 95% CI = -0.47, -0.02), and participants reporting good sleep quality had lower HbA1c than those with poor sleep quality (MD = -0.19%; 95% CI = -0.30, -0.08). The estimated prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with TID was 51.9% (95% CI = 31.2, 72.6). Patients with moderate-to-severe OSA had a trend toward higher HbA1c (MD = 0.39%, 95% CI = -0.08, 0.87). T1D was associated with poorer sleep and high prevalence of OSA. Poor sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and OSA were associated with suboptimal glycemic control in T1D patients.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A sequential approach with imatinib, chemotherapy and transplant for adult Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Final results of the GIMEMA LAL 0904 study In the GIMEMA LAL 0904 protocol, adult Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were treated with chemotherapy for induction and consolidation, followed by maintenance with imatinib. The protocol was subsequently amended and imatinib was incorporated in the induction and post - remission phase together with chemotherapy. Due to the toxicity of this combined approach, the protocol was further amended to a sequential scheme based on imatinib plus steroids as induction, followed by consolidation with chemotherapy plus imatinib and, when applicable, by a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Fifty-one patients (median age: 45.9 years) were enrolled in the final sequential protocol, hereby reported. At the end of induction (day +50), 96% of evaluable patients (n=49) achieved a complete hematologic remission; after consolidation, all were in complete hematologic remission. No deaths in induction were recorded. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 60 months are 48.8% and 45.8%, respectively. At day +50 (end of the imatinib induction), a log - reduction of BCR-ABL1 levels >1.3 was associated with a significantly more prolonged disease-free survival (55.6%, C.I. 95%: 39.0-79.3 vs 20%, C.I. 95%: 5.8-69.1; p =0.03), overall survival (59.1%, C.I. 95%: 42.3-82.6 vs 20%, C.I. 95%: 5.8-69.1, p =0.02) and lower relapse incidence (20.5%, C.I. 95%: 7.2-38.6 vs 60.0%, C.I. 95%: 21.6-84.3, p =0.01). Mean BCR-ABL1 levels remained significantly higher in patients who subsequently relapsed. Finally, BCR-ABL1p190 patients showed a significantly faster molecular response than BCR-ABL1p210 patients (p =0.023). Thought the study was not powered to evaluate the role of allogeneic stem cell transplant, allografting positively impacted on overall survival and disease-free survival. A sequential approach with imatinib alone in induction, consolidated by chemotherapy plus imatinib followed by a stem cell transplant is a feasible, well-tolerated and effective strategy for adult Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to the best long-term survival rates so far reported.

"Somatic molecular subtyping of prostate tumors from HOXB13 G84E carriers A recurrent germline mutation (G84E) in the HOXB13 gene is associated with early onset and family history -positive prostate cancer in patients of European descent, occurring in up to 5% of prostate cancer families. To date, the molecular features of prostate tumors occurring in HOXB13 G84E carriers have not been studied in a large cohort of patients. We identified 101 heterozygous carriers of G84E who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer between 1985 and 2011 and matched these men by race, age and tumor grade to 99 HOXB13 wild-type controls. Immunostaining for HOXB13, PTEN, ERG, p53 and SPINK1 as well as RNA in situ hybridization for ETV1 / 4 / 5 were performed using genetically validated assays. Tumors from G84E carriers generally expressed HOXB13 protein at a level comparable to benign and wild-type glands. ETS gene expression (either ERG or ETV1 / 4 / 5) was seen in 36% (36/101) of tumors from G84E carriers compared to 68% (65/96) of the controls (p < 0.0001). PTEN was lost in 11% (11/101) of G84E carriers compared to 25% (25/99) of the controls (p = 0.014). PTEN loss was enriched among ERG - positive compared to ERG - negative tumors in both groups of patients. Nuclear accumulation of the p53 protein, indicative of underlying TP53 missense mutations, was uncommon in both groups, occurring in 1% (1/101) of the G84E carriers versus 2% (2/92) of the controls (p = NS). Taken together, these data suggest that genes other than ERG and PTEN may drive carcinogenesis / progression in the majority of men with germline HOXB13 mutations.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Polymer Nanoparticles as Smart Carriers for the Enhanced Release of Therapeutic Agents to the CNS The brain is the most protected organ in the human body; its protective shield, relying on a complex system of cells, proteins and transporters, prevents potentially harmful substances from entering the brain from the bloodstream but, on the other hand, it also stops drugs administered via the systemic route. To improve the efficacy of pharmacological treatments, targeted drug delivery by means of polymer nanoparticles is a challenging but, at the same time, efficient strategy. Thanks to a highly multidisciplinary approach, several ways to overcome the brain protection have provided effective solutions to treat a large number of diseases. Important advances in polymer science, together with the development of novel techniques for nanocarrier preparation, and the discovery of novel targeting ligands and molecules, allow a fine-tuning of size, shape, chemicophysical properties and surface chemistry of functional particulate systems; it enables the improvement of the therapeutic performances for several drugs, also toward districts that are difficult to be treated, such as the brain. This review focuses on the great strides made from scientists and doctors in the development of polymer nano-sized drug delivery systems for brain diseases. Even though the optimal nanocarrier was not yet discovered, important advances were made to strive for safer, performant and successful systems, with the expectation to find soon better solutions to cure some still untreatable pathologies.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Influence of glioblastoma contact with the lateral ventricle on survival: a meta-analysis The ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), which lies in the walls of the lateral ventricles (LV), is the largest neurogenic niche within the adult brain. Whether radiographic contact with the LV influences survival in glioblastoma (GBM) patients remains unclear. We assimilated and analyzed published data comparing survival in GBM patients with (LV + GBM) and without (LV - GBM) radiographic LV contact. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane electronic databases were searched. Fifteen studies with survival data on LV + GBM and LV - GBM patients were identified. Their Kaplan-Meier survival curves were digitized and pooled for generation of median overall (OS) and progression free (PFS) survivals and log-rank hazard ratios (HRs). The log-rank and reported multivariate HRs after accounting for the common predictors of GBM survival were analyzed separately by meta-analyses. The calculated median survivals (months) from pooled data were 12.95 and 16.58 (OS), and 4.54 and 6.25 (PFS) for LV + GBMs and LV - GBMs, respectively, with an overall log-rank HRs of 1.335 [1.204-1.513] (OS) and 1.387 [1.225-1.602] (PFS). Meta-analysis of log-rank HRs resulted in summary HRs of 1.58 [1.35-1.85] (OS, 10 studies) and 1.41 [1.22-1.64] (PFS, 5 studies). Meta-analysis of multivariate HRs resulted in summary HRs of 1.35 [1.14-1.58] (OS, 6 studies) and 1.64 [0.88-3.05] (PFS, 3 studies). Patients with GBM contacting the LV have lower survival. This effect may be independent of the common predictors of GBM survival, suggesting a clinical influence of V-SVZ contact on GBM biology.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"The effects of gestational use of antidepressants and antipsychotics on neonatal outcomes for women with severe mental illness Psychotropic medication use occurs in 8% of pregnancies, with rates increasing, and often multiple medications prescribed. This study aims to determine if the use of psychotropic medication, in a cohort of women with severe mental illness, increases rates of special care nursery admission and reports differences between antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use either alone or in combination. A retrospective database analysis from a cohort with severe mental illness in pregnancy identified 268 pregnant women who were grouped according to medication type. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal variables were analysed using t-tests, Ï(2), analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis for special care nursery admission. The medication groups consisted of: women taking no psychotropic medications (n = 67); those taking antipsychotics (n = 87); those taking antidepressants (n = 55); those taking and a combination of antidepressants/antipsychotics (n = 59). Rates of special care nursery admission in women who took psychotropic medication (41.3%) were elevated compared to those who did not (26.9%) (P = 0.035), and were significantly raised when compared to the general population (P < 0.000). No significant difference occurred between the medication groups. A significant adjusted odds ratio of 2.79 (95% CI 1.286-6.049) was found for special care nursery and psychiatric admission during pregnancy but not for psychotropic medication. Rates of special care nursery admission are elevated in neonates of women with severe mental illness taking psychotropic medication, but were not different for monotherapy or polytherapy when prescribing antidepressants or antipsychotic medication. Additional vulnerability occurs in the neonates of women with a mental illness and paediatric presence at delivery is recommended.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The Experience of Women Veterans Coming Back from War Issues surrounding mental health are common for women veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The goal of this phenomenological study was to document themes in the stories gathered from eight women veterans who had come back from war. Themes in the stories were: arriving with mixed sentiments; evolving to a changed view of self; permeating aggravation; confounding broken relationships, frequent deployments, and change in military status; remembering war experiences; and seeking opportunity for what is possible. Mental health issues can be observed in the themes.

"Hybrid automata models of cardiac ventricular electrophysiology for real-time computational applications Virtual heart models have been proposed for closed loop validation of safety - critical embedded medical devices, such as pacemakers. These models must react in real-time to off-the-shelf medical devices. Real-time performance can be obtained by implementing models in computer hardware, and methods of compiling classes of Hybrid Automata (HA) onto FPGA have been developed. Models of ventricular cardiac cell electrophysiology have been described using HA which capture the complex nonlinear behavior of biological systems. However, many models that have been used for closed-loop validation of pacemakers are highly abstract and do not capture important characteristics of the dynamic rate response. We developed a new HA model of cardiac cells which captures dynamic behavior and we implemented the model in hardware. This potentially enables modeling the heart with over 1 million dynamic cells, making the approach ideal for closed loop testing of medical devices.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Environmental fate and effects of novel quorum sensing inhibitors that can control biofilm formation The formation of bacterial biofilms can have negative impacts on industrial processes and are typically difficult to control. The increase of antibiotic resistance, in combination with the requirement for more environmentally focused approaches, has placed pressure on industry and the scientific community to reassess biofilm control strategies. The discovery of bacterial quorum sensing, as an important mechanism in biofilm formation, has led to the development of new substances (such as halogenated thiophenones) to inhibit the quorum sensing process. However, there are currently limited data regarding the biodegradability or ecotoxicity of these substances. To assess the environmental fate and effects of thiophenones capable of quorum sensing inhibition, candidate substances were first identified that have potentially high biodegradability and low ecotoxicity using quantitative structure activity relationships. Subsequent confirmatory hazard assessment of these substances, using a marine alga and a marine crustacean, indicated that these estimates were significantly under predicted with acute toxicity values more than three orders of magnitude lower than anticipated combined with limited biodegradability. Therefore, although these quorum sensing inhibitors appear a promising approach to control biofilms, they may also have environmental impacts on certain aquatic organisms.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The transcription factors MS188 and AMS form a complex to activate the expression of CYP703A2 for sporopollenin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana The sexine layer of pollen grain is mainly composed of sporopollenins. The sporophytic secretory tapetum is required for the biosynthesis of sporopollenin. Although several enzymes involved in sporopollenin biosynthesis have been reported, the regulatory mechanism of these enzymes in tapetal layer remains elusive. ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS) and MALE STERILE 188 / MYB103 / MYB80 (MS188 / MYB103 / MYB80) are two tapetal cell -specific transcription factors required for pollen wall formation. AMS functions upstream of MS188. Here we report that AMS and MS188 target the CYP703A2 gene, which is involved in sporopollenin biosynthesis. We found that AMS and MS188 were localized in tapetum while CYP703A2 was localized in both tapetum and locule. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that MS188 directly bound to the promoter of CYP703A2 and luciferase-inducible assay showed that MS188 activated the expression of CYP703A2. Yeast two-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) further demonstrated that MS188 complexed with AMS. The expression of CYP703A2 could be partially restored by the elevated levels of MS188 in the ams mutant. Therefore, our data reveal that MS188 coordinates with AMS to activate CYP703A2 in sporopollenin biosynthesis of plant tapetum.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Pre-existing renal lesions revealed after renal trauma, Difficulties in diagnosis and accountability: About 14 cases Pre-existing renal lesions (PERL) may interfere with the patho-physiology of trauma, alter the radiographic imaging and influence the therapeutic approach. The aims of this study were to record the PERL found incidentally during blunt renal trauma, to specify the place for effective conservative management and to determin the estimated partial permanent disability (PPD). The medical records of 14 patients with PERL and blunt renal trauma were reviewed. In each patient, pre-existing renal abnormalities, clinical symptoms, CT scan study findings, associated injuries, therapeutic approach, the accountability criteria and the estimated PPD were recorded. There were 11 men and 3 women with a mean age of 35,6 years (range 19-66 years). Renal trauma was due to a traffic accident in 8 patients. Renal damage appeared to be disproportionate to the severity of the trauma (minor trauma). They had a lower rate of associated trauma to other abdominal organs (four patients only). Urinary stones were present in 5 patients, pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction in 3, horseshoe kidny in 3, ectopic kidney in 2 and upper urinary tract carcinoma in one case. Early nephrectomy was required in three cases for hemodynamic instability. Ureteral stenting was indicated in 3 cases. Six patients were operated later because of their underlying renal pathology. A conservative treatment was possible only in 7 of cases. The PPD related to renal trauma varide from 0 to 13% in all cases. PERL may complicate a negligible renal trauma while in some cases they may be of vital importance for the patient's final outcome. The imaging findings are crucial but may be confusing. The therapeutic approach is, to a large extent, dependent on the type of PERL and the severity of damage, and is often conservative in the hemo-dynamically stable patient. Accountability link may be difficult to establish and the PPD depends on the PERL and the renal injuries severity. We have no involvement with funding in this case.

"The kinesin motor protein Kif7 is required for T-cell development and normal MHC expression on thymic epithelial cells (TEC) in the thymus Kif7 is a ciliary kinesin motor protein that regulates mammalian Hedgehog pathway activation through influencing structure of the primary cilium. Here we show that Kif7 is required for normal T-cell development, despite the fact that T-cells lack primary cilia. Analysis of Kif7 - deficient thymus showed that Kif7 - deficiency increases the early CD44+ CD25+ CD4- CD8- thymocyte progenitor population but reduces differentiation to CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) cell. At the transition from DP to mature T-cell, Kif7 - deficiency selectively delayed maturation to the CD8 lineage. Expression of CD5, which correlates with TCR signal strength, was reduced on DP and mature CD4 and CD8 cells, as a result of thymocyte - intrinsic Kif7 - deficiency, and Kif7 - deficient T-cells from radiation chimeras activated less efficiently when stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in vitro. Kif7 - deficient thymocytes showed higher expression of the Hedgehog target gene Ptch1 than WT, but were less sensitive to treatment with recombinant Shh, and Kif7 - deficient T-cell development was refractory to neutralisation of endogenous Hh proteins, indicating that Kif7 - deficient thymocytes were unable to interpret changes in the Hedgehog signal. In addition, Kif7 - deficiency reduced cell-surface MHCII expression on thymic epithelial cells.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Sensory coding and cognitive processing of sound in Veterans with blast exposure Recent anecdotal reports from VA audiology clinics as well as a few published studies have identified a sub-population of Service Members seeking treatment for problems communicating in everyday, noisy listening environments despite having normal to near-normal hearing thresholds. Because of their increased risk of exposure to dangerous levels of prolonged noise and transient explosive blast events, communication problems in these soldiers could be due to either hearing loss (traditional or ""hidden"") in the auditory sensory periphery or from blast-induced injury to cortical networks associated with attention. We found that out of the 14 blast-exposed Service Members recruited for this study, 12 had hearing thresholds in the normal to near-normal range. A majority of these participants reported having problems specifically related to failures with selective attention. Envelope following responses (EFRs) measuring neural coding fidelity of the auditory brainstem to suprathreshold sounds were similar between blast-exposed and non-blast controls. Blast-exposed subjects performed substantially worse than non-blast controls in an auditory selective attention task in which listeners classified the melodic contour (rising, falling, or "" zig-zagging "") of one of three simultaneous, competing tone sequences. Salient pitch and spatial differences made for easy segregation of the three concurrent melodies. Poor performance in the blast-exposed subjects was associated with weaker evoked response potentials (ERPs) in frontal EEG channels, as well as a failure of attention to enhance the neural responses evoked by a sequence when it was the target compared to when it was a distractor. These results suggest that communication problems in these listeners cannot be explained by compromised sensory representations in the auditory periphery, but rather point to lingering blast-induced damage to cortical networks implicated in the control of attention. Because all study participants also suffered from post-traumatic disorder (PTSD), follow-up studies are required to tease apart the contributions of PTSD and blast-induced injury on cognitive performance.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"microRNA-145 Mediates the Inhibitory Effect of Adipose Tissue -Derived Stromal Cells on Prostate Cancer Adipose-derived stromal cell (ASC), known as one of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), is a promising tool for regenerative medicine; however, the effect of ASCs on tumor growth has not been studied sufficiently. We investigated the hypothesis that ASCs have an inhibitory effect on metastatic tumor progression. To evaluate the in vitro inhibitory effect of ASCs on metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), direct coculture and indirect separate culture experiments with PC3M-luc2 cells and human ASCs were performed, and ASCs were administered to PC3M-luc2 cell -derived tumor -bearing nude mice for in vivo experiment. We also performed exosome microRNA (miRNA) array analysis to explore a mechanistic insight into the effect of ASCs on PCa cell proliferation / apoptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments exhibited the inhibitory effect of ASCs on PC3M-luc2 cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis and PCa growth, respectively. Among upregulated miRNAs in ASCs compared with fibroblasts, we focused on miR-145, which was known as a tumor suppressor. ASC -derived conditioned medium (CM) significantly inhibited PC3M-luc2 cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, but the effect was canceled by miR-145 knockdown in ASCs. ASC miR-145 knockdown CM also reduced the expression of Caspase 3 / 7 with increased antiapoptotic protein, BclxL, expression in PC3M-luc2 cells. This study provides preclinical data that ASCs inhibit PCa growth, inducing PCa cell apoptosis with reduced activity of BclxL, at least in part, by miR-145, including exosomes released from ASCs, suggesting that ASC administration could be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy in patients with PCa.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Intervention study evaluating antibiotic prescribing following educational sessions for urinary tract infection, skin and soft tissue infection, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial sinusitis. A total of 26 out of 43 (60%) nurse practitioners in 4 urgent care centers were enrolled in the study. The rate of inappropriate antibiotic use among all conditions was 10% before and 8% after the intervention (p = .02). A decrease in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing was seen after the educational session (p < .01). The most common reasons for inappropriate antibiotic prescribing were too broad (41%), wrong dosage (22%), and not indicated (17%). Educational sessions led to improvement in overall inappropriate antibiotic use. Additional stewardship interventions are needed to further reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Teleophthalmology image-based navigated retinal laser therapy for diabetic macular edema: a concept of retinal telephotocoagulation To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a retinal telephotocoagulation treatment plan for diabetic macular edema. Prospective, interventional cohort study at two clinical sites. Sixteen eyes of ten subjects with diabetic macular edema underwent navigated focal laser photocoagulation using a novel teleretinal treatment plan. Clinic 1 (King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) collected retinal images and fundus fluorescein angiogram. Clinic 2 (Palmetto Retina Center, West Columbia, SC, USA) created image -based treatment plans based on which macular laser photocoagulation was performed back at clinic 1. The primary outcome of the study was feasibility of image transfer and performing navigated laser photocoagulation for subjects with diabetic macular edema between two distant clinics. Secondary measures were change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography at 3 months after treatment. The teleretinal treatment plan was able to be successfully completed in all 16 eyes. The mean logMAR BCVA at baseline was 0.49 Â± 0.1, which remained stable (0.45 Â± 0.1) 3 months after treatment (p = 0.060). The CRT improved from 290.1 Â± 37.6 Î¼m at baseline to 270.8 Â± 27.7 Î¼m 3 months after treatment (p = 0.005). All eyes demonstrated improvement in the area of retinal edema after laser photocoagulation, and no eyes demonstrated visual acuity loss 3 months after treatment. This study introduces the concept of retinal telephotocoagulation for diabetic macular edema, and demonstrates the feasibility and safety of using telemedicine to perform navigated retinal laser treatments regardless of geographical distance.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Demonstration of a bronchobiliary fistula using magnetic resonance image with hepatospecific contrast agent Bronchobiliary fistulas are a rare entity of difficult diagnosis. The utility of magnetic resonance image (MRI) with hepatospecific contrast agents to demonstrate such condition is seldom described in the literature. This case reports a patient with pulmonary infection with a past history of hepatic surgery for hydatid disease in whom the presence of bile in the sputum rose the suspicious of a bronchobiliary fistula.

"A Delayed Diagnosis of Chronic Mesenteric Ischaemia: The Role of Clinicians ' Cognitive Errors Chronic diarrhoeal illnesses with nausea and weight loss are a common indication for gastroenterology review. While many such cases have intra-luminal aetiologies, such as inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease or other malabsorptive conditions, with many other cases due to functional gut disorders or systemic malignancy, clinicians must also keep vascular disorders in mind. Here we report a patient with a delayed diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischaemia after 6 months of gastrointestinal symptoms strongly mimicking an alternative diagnosis such as inflammatory bowel disease due an atypical predominance of nausea and diarrhoea rather than pain. We briefly review the literature on treatment of this condition but also discuss with particular attention the sequence of cognitive errors made by clinicians that led to a diagnostic delay, inviting readers to thus reflect on how such errors can be minimised in their practice.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Psychological and sexual effects of circumcision in adult males Our aim was to investigate the psychological and sexual effects of circumcision in adult men, and analyze these changes following circumcision. We included 37 adults who applied to our clinic for circumcision and who did not have any psychiatric or urologic disorders and age -matched 30 controls in our study. Body Cathexis Scale (BCS), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), and Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) were applied to the study group twice, once before and once three months after circumcision, and only once in the control group. Also, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was noted and premature ejaculation (PE) evaluation was done. Intra- and intergroup comparisons were performed. The two groups were similar with regard to demographic data. Comparison of preoperative BCS and LSAS scores with the scores of the control group showed significant differences (p=0.003, p<0.001, and p<0.001, respectively). However, postoperative scores were similar to the scores obtained in the control group (p=0.768, p>0.05, and p>0.05, respectively). Scores of all scales showed significant improvements postoperatively. Also, PEDT scores and IELT changes before and after circumcision were significant in the study group, but not when compared to the control group. Our results indicated that social anxiety and anxiety levels decreased after circumcision in adult Turkish men, and their body gratification increased. We found that not being circumcised might negatively affect individuals in adulthood when it comes to body image and sexual satisfaction, however, both improve after circumcision.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Development and validation of diagnostic criteria for IBD subtypes with an emphasis on IBD-Unclassified in children: a multicenter study from the Pediatric IBD Porto group of ESPGHAN The revised Porto criteria identify subtypes of pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases: ulcerative colitis (UC), atypical UC, Inflammatory Bowel Disease Unclassified (IBDU), and Crohn's disease (CD). In continuation of the Porto criteria, we aimed to derive and validate criteria for standardizing the classification of the IBD subtypes. This was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study from 23 centers affiliated with the Porto-group of ESPGHAN. Both a hypothesis-driven judgmental approach and mathematical CART modeling were utilized for creating a diagnostic algorithm. Since small bowel inflammation is easily recognized as CD, we focused here primarily on the phenotype of colitis. 749 IBD children were enrolled- 236 (32%) Crohn's colitis, 272 (36%) UC and 241 (32%(IBDU (age 10.9Â±3.6 years) with a median follow-up of 2.8 years (IQR 1.7-4.3). A total of 23 features were clustered in 3 classes according to their prevalence in UC: 6 class-1 (0% prevalence in UC), 12 class-2 (<5% prevalence) and 5 class-3 (5-10% prevalence). According to the algorithm, the disease should be classified as UC if no features exist in any of the classes. When at least one feature exist, different combinations classify the disease into atypical UC, IBDU and CD. The algorithm differentiated UC from CD and IBDU with 80% sensitivity (95% CI 71-88%) and 84% specificity (77-89%), and CD from IBDU and UC with 78% sensitivity (67-87%) and 94% specificity (89-97%). The validated algorithm can adequately classify children with IBD into small bowel CD, Colonic CD, IBDU, atypical UC and UC.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Fuzheng Qingjie Granules Inhibit Growth of Hepatoma Cells via Inducing Mitochondria -Mediated Apoptosis and Enhancing Immune Function Fuzheng Qingjie (FZQJ) granules, a compound Chinese medicine, have been used as an adjuvant therapy for alimentary tract cancers. However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms are still not well understood. In the present study, HepG2 cells were treated with FZQJ - containing serum. Cell proliferation was evaluated using MTT assay. Apoptosis was analyzed using a flow cytometer. Cell ultrastructure was observed under a transmission electron microscope. The mitochondrial membrane potential (ÎÏ) was examined with JC-1 dye. In H22 tumor-bearing mice, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD3(+) T cells, and natural killer cells (NK) in peripheral blood were evaluated cytometrically. Interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± levels were measured using radioimmunoassay .The mRNA levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The protein levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome C, caspase 3 and 9, PARP, and CD69 were examined by Western blotting. The apoptotic cells in tissues were observed using TUNEL method. Alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CRE) were detected by an automatic biochemical analyzer. The results showed that FZQJ - containing serum remarkably inhibited proliferation of HepG2 cells in dose - and time - dependent manners, induced HepG2 cell apoptosis and caused a decrease of ÎÏ. Analysis of tumor tissue showed that FZQJ - induced apoptosis was accompanied by downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 3 and 9, and cleavage of PARP. In addition, FZQJ increased the percentages of CD4(+) T and NK cells, the ratio of CD4(+) / CD8(+) T cells as well as the levels of serum TNF-Î±. FZQJ also increased CD69 expression in tumor tissue. No hepatorenal toxicity was observed in H22 tumor-bearing mice. These results indicated that FZQJ could inhibit the growth of hepatoma cells via regulating immune function and inducing mitochondria mediated apoptosis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Forensic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the Chinese Yi population via 19 X-chromosomal STR loci The demographic characteristics and genetic polymorphism data of 56 Chinese nationalities or 31 administrative divisions in Chinese mainland have repeatedly been the genetic research hotspots. While most genetic studies focused on some particular Chinese populations based on autosomal or Y-chromosomal genetic markers, the forensic characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the seventh largest Chinese population (Yi ethnicity) on the X-chromosomal genetic markers are scarce. Here, allele frequencies and forensic statistical parameters for 19 X-chromosomal short tandem repeat loci (DXS7424-DXS101, DXS6789-DXS6809, DXS7423-DXS10134, DXS10103-HPRTB-DXS10101, DXS10159-DXS10162-DXS10164, DXS10148-DXS10135-DXS8378, and DXS7132-DXS10079-DXS10074-DXS10075) of 331 Chinese Yi individuals were obtained. All 19 X-chromosomal short tandem repeat (STR) loci in females were consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. A total of 214 alleles were identified with the corresponding allele frequencies spanned from 0.0019 to 0.6106. The combined PE, PDF, and PDM were 0.9999999214, 0.9999999999999999999993, and 0.9999999999998, respectively. The high combined MECKrÃ¼ger, MECKishida, MECDesmarais, and MECDesmarais Duo were achieved as 0.9999999617638, 0.9999999999971, 0.9999999999971, and 0.9999999931538, respectively. The findings suggested that the panel of 19 X-STR loci is highly polymorphic and informative in the Yi ethnic population and can be considered to be a powerful tool in forensic complex kinship identification. Population differentiation analyses among 12 populations indicated that significant differences in genetic structure were observed in between the Yi ethnicity and the Chinese Uyghur as well as Kazakh, and genetic homogeneity existed in similar ethno-origin or geographic origin populations.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Workplace Violence and Job Outcomes of Newly Licensed Nurses The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of workplace violence toward newly licensed nurses and the relationship between workplace violence and job outcomes. An online survey was conducted of newly licensed registered nurses who had obtained their license in 2012 or 2013 in South Korea and had been working for 5-12 months after first being employed. The sample consisted of 312 nurses working in hospitals or clinics. The Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire II was used to measure violence and nurse job outcomes. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between violence and job outcomes. Verbal abuse was most prevalent (59.6%), followed by threats of violence (36.9%), physical violence (27.6%), bullying (25.6%), and sexual harassment (22.4%). Approximately three quarters of the nurses had experienced at least one type of violence. The main perpetrators were patients and nurse colleagues, although the distribution of perpetrators varied depending on the type of violence. Bullying had a significant relationship with all four job outcomes (job satisfaction, burnout, commitment to the workplace, and intent to leave), while verbal abuse was associated with all job outcomes except for intent to leave. Violence perpetrated by nurse colleagues had a significant relationship with all four job outcomes, while violence by physicians had a significant inverse relationship with job satisfaction. Workplace violence is experienced by a high percentage of newly licensed nurses, and is associated with their job outcomes.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus in bovine mastitis and correlation to phenotypic characteristics Reducing the prevalence of mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is essential to improve animal health and reduce economic losses for farmers. The clinical outcome of acute mastitis and risk of progression to persistent mastitis can, at least to some extent, be related to genetic variants of the strain causing the infection. In the present study we have used microarrays to investigate the presence of virulence genes in S. aureus isolates from dairy cows with acute clinical mastitis (n=70) and correlated the findings to other genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Among the most commonly found virulence factors were genes encoding several hemolysin types, leukocidins D and lukM / lukF-P83, clumping factors A and B, fibrinogen binding protein and fibronectin-binding protein A. Some virulence factors e.g. fibronectin-binding protein B and Staphylococcus aureus surface protein G were less common. Genes coding for several staphylococcal enterotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) were commonly found, especially in one major pulsotype. No beta-lactamase genes were found in any common pulsotype, while present in some rare pulsotypes, indicated to be of human origin. Production of TSST-1, enterotoxins, hemolysins and beta-lactamase could all be positively correlated to presence of the corresponding genes. This study reveals a number of genotypic differences and similarities among common and rare pulsotypes of S. aureus from cases of mastitis in Sweden. The results could help the design of diagnostic tools to guide on-farm interventions according to the expected impact on udder health from a specific S. aureus genotype.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Functional Analysis of a Bacterial Antifreeze Protein Indicates a Cooperative Effect between Its Two Ice-Binding Domains Antifreeze proteins make up a class of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that are possessed and expressed by certain cold - adapted organisms to enhance their freezing tolerance. Here we report the biophysical and functional characterization of an IBP discovered in a bacterium recovered from a deep glacial ice core drilled at Vostok Station, Antarctica (IBPv). Our study showed that the recombinant protein rIBPv exhibited a thermal hysteresis of 2 Â°C at concentrations of >50 Î¼M, effectively inhibited ice recrystallization, and enhanced bacterial viability during freeze-thaw cycling. Circular dichroism scans indicated that rIBPv mainly consists of Î² strands, and its denaturing temperature was 53.5 Â°C. Multiple-sequence alignment of homologous IBPs predicted that IBPv contains two ice-binding domains, a feature unique among known IBPs. To examine functional differences between the IBPv domains, each domain was cloned, expressed, and purified. The second domain (domain B) expressed greater ice binding activity. Data from thermal hysteresis and gel filtration assays supported the idea that the two domains cooperate to achieve a higher ice binding effect by forming heterodimers. However, physical linkage of the domains was not required for this effect.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Transformation of Lettuce with rol ABC Genes: Extracts Show Enhanced Antioxidant, Analgesic, Anti-Inflammatory, Antidepressant, and Anticoagulant Activities in Rats Lettuce is an edible crop that is well known for dietary and antioxidant benefits. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of rol ABC genes on antioxidant and medicinal potential of lettuce by Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. Transgene integration and expression was confirmed through PCR and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. The transformed plants showed 91-102 % increase in total phenolic contents and 53-65 % increase in total flavonoid contents compared to untransformed plants. Total antioxidant capacity and total reducing power increased up to 112 and 133 % in transformed plants, respectively. Results of DPPH assay showed maximum 51 % increase, and lipid peroxidation assay exhibited 20 % increase in antioxidant activity of transformed plants compared to controls. Different in vivo assays were carried out in rats. The transgenic plants showed up to 80 % inhibition in both hot plate analgesic assay and carrageenan - induced hind paw edema test, while untransformed plants showed only 45 % inhibition. Antidepressant and anticoagulant potential of transformed plants was also significantly enhanced compared to untransformed plants. Taken together, the present work highlights the use of rol genes to enhance the secondary metabolite production in lettuce and improve its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, and anticoagulatory properties.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Intranasal Insulin Prevents Anesthesia - Induced Cognitive Impairment and Chronic Neurobehavioral Changes General anesthesia increases the risk for cognitive impairment post operation, especially in the elderly and vulnerable individuals. Recent animal studies on the impact of anesthesia on postoperative cognitive impairment have provided some valuable insights, but much remains to be understood. Here, by using mice of various ages and conditions, we found that anesthesia with propofol and sevoflurane caused significant deficits in spatial learning and memory, as tested using Morris Water Maze (MWM) 2-6 days after anesthesia exposure, in aged (17-18 months old) wild-type (WT) mice and in adult (7-8 months old) 3xTg-AD mice (a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)), but not in adult WT mice. Anesthesia resulted in long-term neurobehavioral changes in the fear conditioning task carried out 65 days after exposure to anesthesia in 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, daily intranasal administration of insulin (1.75 U/ mouse / day) for only 3 days prior to anesthesia completely prevented the anesthesia - induced deficits in spatial learning and memory and the long-term neurobehavioral changes tested 65 days after exposure to anesthesia in 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that aging and AD -like brain pathology increase the vulnerability to cognitive impairment after anesthesia and that intranasal treatment with insulin can prevent anesthesia - induced cognitive impairment.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"miR-27b inhibits gastric cancer metastasis by targeting NR2F2 Increasing attention is focused on the down-regulation of miRNAs in cancer process. Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR2F2, also known as COUP-TFII) is involved in the development of many types of cancers, but its role in gastric cancer remains elusive. In this experiment, oncomine and Kaplan-meier database revealed that NR2F2 was up-regulated in gastric cancer and that the high NR2F2 expression contributed to poor survival. MicroRNA-27b was targeted and down-regulated by NR2F2 in human gastric cancer tissues and cells. The ectopic expression of miR-27b inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Assays suggested that the overexpression of miR-27b could promote MGC-803 cells ' migration and invasion and retard their metastasis to the liver. In addition, down-regulation of miR-27b enhanced GES-1 cells ' proliferation and metastasis in vitro. These findings reveal that miR-27b is a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer and a biomarker for improving patients ' survival.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Non-inferiority trials: are they inferior? A systematic review of reporting in major medical journals To assess the adequacy of reporting of non-inferiority trials alongside the consistency and utility of current recommended analyses and guidelines. Review of randomised clinical trials that used a non-inferiority design published between January 2010 and May 2015 in medical journals that had an impact factor >10 (JAMA Internal Medicine, Archives Internal Medicine, PLOS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine). Ovid (MEDLINE). We searched for non-inferiority trials and assessed the following: choice of non-inferiority margin and justification of margin; power and significance level for sample size; patient population used and how this was defined; any missing data methods used and assumptions declared and any sensitivity analyses used. A total of 168 trial publications were included. Most trials concluded non-inferiority (132; 79%). The non-inferiority margin was reported for 98% (164), but less than half reported any justification for the margin (77; 46%). While most chose two different analyses (91; 54%) the most common being intention-to-treat (ITT) or modified ITT and per-protocol, a large number of articles only chose to conduct and report one analysis (65; 39%), most commonly the ITT analysis. There was lack of clarity or inconsistency between the type I error rate and corresponding CIs for 73 (43%) articles. Missing data were rarely considered with (99; 59%) not declaring whether imputation techniques were used. Reporting and conduct of non-inferiority trials is inconsistent and does not follow the recommendations in available statistical guidelines, which are not wholly consistent themselves. Authors should clearly describe the methods used and provide clear descriptions of and justifications for their design and primary analysis. Failure to do this risks misleading conclusions being drawn, with consequent effects on clinical practice.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The recurrent domestication of viruses: major evolutionary transitions in parasitic wasps Several lineages of endoparasitoid wasps, which develop inside the body of other insects, have domesticated viruses, used as delivery tools of essential virulence factors for the successful development of their progeny. Virus domestication s are major evolutionary transitions in highly diverse parasitoid wasps. Much progress has recently been made to characterize the nature of these ancestrally captured endogenous viruses that have evolved within the wasp genomes. Virus domestication from different viral families occurred at least three times in parasitoid wasps. This evolutionary convergence led to different strategies. Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are viral gene transfer agents and virus -like particles of the wasp Venturia canescens deliver proteins. Here, we take the standpoint of parasitoid wasps to review current knowledge on virus domestications by different parasitoid lineages. Then, based on genomic data from parasitoid wasps, PDVs and exogenous viruses, we discuss the different evolutionary steps required to transform viruses into vehicles for the delivery of the virulence molecules that we observe today. Finally, we discuss how endoparasitoid wasps manipulate host physiology and ensure parasitism success, to highlight the possible advantages of viral domestication as compared with other virulence strategies.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Association of Exclusive Breastfeeding Duration With Systemic Inflammation Markers in Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study Breastfeeding duration has been associated with less low-grade inflammation in healthy adolescents, but there is scarce information regarding obese subjects. This study aimed to evaluate whether exclusive breastfeeding is related to serum concentrations of inflammatory markers in a population of Spanish adolescents. A cross-sectional study was performed on 1,001 adolescents (13.2 Â± 1.2 years) randomly recruited from schools in southeast Spain. Data on breastfeeding duration were collected via a parental questionnaire. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C-reactive protein (CRP) was determined by solid-phase chemiluminescent immunometric assay. Nonadjusted and adjusted multivariate correlation analyses confirmed a strong association (p < .001, 95% confidence interval) between the three markers of inflammation and exclusive breastfeeding duration. No significant differences were observed for IL-6, TNF-Î±, and CRP serum concentrations among normal weight, overweight, and obese adolescents, except for IL-6 between normal weight and obese subjects. Likewise, no significant association was found between these markers of inflammation and body mass index (BMI) z-score. We found a possible association between inflammatory markers and exclusive breastfeeding duration in adolescents, regardless of their BMI. This finding suggests that increased body weight or obesity might not mediate the association between breastfeeding and inflammation. These results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between breastfeeding and inflammatory markers in adolescents.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"In vivo Distribution and Clearance of Purified Capsular Polysaccharide from Burkholderia pseudomallei in a Murine Model Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a severe infection prominent in northern Australia and Southeast Asia. The "" gold standard "" for melioidosis diagnosis is bacterial isolation, which takes several days to complete. The resulting delay in diagnosis leads to delayed treatments, which could result in death. In an attempt to develop better methods for early diagnosis of melioidosis, B. pseudomallei capsular polysaccharide (CPS) was identified as an important diagnostic biomarker. A rapid lateral flow immunoassay utilizing CPS - specific monoclonal antibody was developed and tested in endemic regions worldwide. However, the in vivo fate and clearance of CPS has never been thoroughly investigated. Here, we injected mice with purified CPS intravenously and determined CPS concentrations in serum, urine, and major organs at various intervals. The results indicate that CPS is predominantly eliminated through urine and no CPS accumulation occurs in the major organs. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that intact CPS was excreted through urine. To understand how a large molecule like CPS was eliminated without degradation, a 3-dimenational structure of CPS was modeled. The predicted CPS structure has a rod-like shape with a small diameter that could allow it to flow through the glomerulus of the kidney. CPS clearance was determined using exponential decay models and the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. The results show that CPS has a relatively short serum half-life of 2.9 to 4.4 hours. Therefore, the presence of CPS in the serum and/or urine suggests active melioidosis infection and provides a marker to monitor treatment of melioidosis.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Isolation, structural analysis, and expression characteristics of the maize nuclear factor Y gene families NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) has been shown to play an important role in growth, development, and response to environmental stress. A NF-Y complex, which consists of three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and, NF-YC, binds to CCAAT sequences in a promoter to control the expression of target genes. Although NF-Y proteins have been reported in Arabidopsis and rice, a comprehensive and systematic analysis of ZmNF-Y genes has not yet been performed. To examine the functions of ZmNF-Y genes in this family, we isolated and characterized 50 ZmNF-Y (14 ZmNF-YA, 18 ZmNF-YB, and 18 ZmNF-YC) genes in an analysis of the maize genome. The 50 ZmNF-Y genes were distributed on all 10 maize chromosomes, and 12 paralogs were identified. Multiple alignments showed that maize ZmNF-Y family proteins had conserved regions and relatively variable N-terminal or C-terminal domains. The comparative syntenic map illustrated 40 paralogous NF-Y gene pairs among the 10 maize chromosomes. Microarray data showed that the ZmNF-Y genes had tissue-specific expression patterns in various maize developmental stages and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The results suggested that ZmNF-YB2, 4, 8, 10, 13, and 16 and ZmNF-YC6, 8, and 15 were induced, while ZmNF-YA1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, ZmNF-YB15, and ZmNF-YC3 and 9 were suppressed by drought stress. ZmNF-YA3, ZmNF-YA8 and ZmNF-YA12 were upregulated after infection by the three pathogens, while ZmNF-YA1 and ZmNF-YB2 were suppressed. These results indicate that the ZmNF-Ys may have significant roles in the response to abiotic and biotic stresses.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Angiopoietin-like protein 4 improves glucose tolerance and insulin resistance but induces liver steatosis in high-fat-diet mice Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Angptl4) is a secreted protein predominantly expressed in liver and adipose tissues, and has been identified as an adipokine. Angptl4 is the target gene of peroxisome proliferatorâactivated receptors, which are widely used as lipidâlowering and antiâdiabetic drugs, and previous studies have demonstrated that Angptl4 is able to directly stimulate adipocyte lipolysis. The current study focused on how Angptl4 was involved in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism in highâfatâdiet (HFD) C57 mice. In the present study, mice were divided into three groups, with standard chow mice as a normal control, adenovirus (adv)â injected HFD mice as a model control and adv â Angptl4 â injected HFD mice as the Angptl4+ group. Firstly, compared with the normal control group, mice in the model control group gained more body weight with severe liver steatosis and increased serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In the Angptl4+ group, Angptl4 reduced the weight growth rate, aggravated hepatic steatosis and further increased all the aforementioned serum indexes. Secondly, compared with the normal control, the model control group had a reduced glucose tolerance and developed insulin resistance. Angptl4 expression and the phosphorylation levels of several insulin signaling pathwayâassociated genes, insulin receptor substrate 1, protein kinase B, janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 were downregulated in the liver samples. Adv â Angptl4 injection was observed to improve glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. The genes measured were identified to be upregulated close to normal levels. All the results suggested that Angptl4 served an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism in HFDâinduced obese mice, and this may have a great significance for treatment of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and other diseases.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Proximal Soil Sensing - A Contribution for Species Habitat Distribution Modelling of Earthworms in Agricultural Soils? Earthworms are important for maintaining soil ecosystem functioning and serve as indicators of soil fertility. However, detection of earthworms is time-consuming, which hinders the assessment of earthworm abundances with high sampling density over entire fields. Recent developments of mobile terrestrial sensor platforms for proximal soil sensing (PSS) provided new tools for collecting dense spatial information of soils using various sensing principles. Yet, the potential of PSS for assessing earthworm habitats is largely unexplored. This study investigates whether PSS data contribute to the spatial prediction of earthworm abundances in species distribution models of agricultural soils. Proximal soil sensing data, e.g., soil electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and near infrared absorbance (NIR), were collected in real-time in a field with two management strategies (reduced tillage / conventional tillage) and sandy to loam soils. PSS was related to observations from a long-term (11 years) earthworm observation study conducted at 42 plots. Earthworms were sampled from 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2 mÂ³ soil blocks and identified to species level. Sensor data were highly correlated with earthworm abundances observed in reduced tillage but less correlated with earthworm abundances observed in conventional tillage. This may indicate that management influences the sensor - earthworm relationship. Generalized additive models and state-space models showed that modelling based on data fusion from EC, pH, and NIR sensors produced better results than modelling without sensor data or data from just a single sensor. Regarding the individual earthworm species, particular sensor combinations were more appropriate than others due to the different habitat requirements of the earthworms. Earthworm species with soil -specific habitat preferences were spatially predicted with higher accuracy by PSS than more ubiquitous species. Our findings suggest that PSS contributes to the spatial modelling of earthworm abundances at field scale and that it will support species distribution modelling in the attempt to understand the soil - earthworm relationships in agroecosystems.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to catheter -associated inferior vena cava thrombosis Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for thrombotic complications. The use of central venous catheters as dialysis vascular access additionally increases this risk. We describe the first case of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) secondary to central venous catheter misplacement in a patient with CKD. A 30-year-old female patient with HIV/AIDS and CKD on hemodialysis was admitted to the emergency room for complaints of fever, prostration, and headache in the last six days. She had a tunneled dialysis catheter placed at the left jugular vein. The diagnosis of BCS was established by abdominal computed tomography that showed a partial thrombus within the inferior vena cava which extended from the right atrium to medium hepatic vein, and continuing along the left hepatic vein. Patient was treated with anticoagulants and discharged asymptomatic. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare medical condition caused by hepatic veins thrombosis. It can involve one, two, or all three of the major hepatic veins. It is usually related to myeloproliferative disorders, malignancy and hypercoagulable states. This case calls attention for inadvertent catheter tip placement into hepatic vein leading to this rare complication. Assessment of catheter dialysis tip location with radiological image seems to be a prudent measure after each procedure even if the tunneled dialysis catheter has been introduced with fluoroscopy image.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Influence of biological scaffold regulation on the proliferation of chondrocytes and the repair of articular cartilage To investigate the effects of hard tissue engineering scaffold (the material is Î²-TCP) with different micro-structures on the proliferation of chondrocytes, and the influence of its composite erythrocytes on the repair of articular cartilage defects. Rabbit cartilage cells were on Î²-TCP bioceramic scaffold with different micro-structures in vitro, the proliferation growth trend of chondrocytes within the scaffold was calculated, and a optimal micro-structure suitable for cartilage cell growth was determined. Composite chondrocytes were implanted into rabbit models of articular cartilage defects, and the repair situation was observed. the bioceramic scaffold with an inner diameter of 120 Î¼m and an aperture of 500-630 Î¼m was suitable for the growth of cartilage cells.

"Human brucellosis in South Africa: Public health and diagnostic pitfalls Human brucellosis in South Africa (SA) is under-diagnosed and under-reported. This is because many clinicians have little or no experience in managing affected patients, and in part because of the nonspecific and insidious nature of the disease. A case of human brucellosis caused by Brucella melitensis in a patient from the Western Cape Province of SA is described, and the resulting exposure of staff members at two medical microbiology laboratories, as well as the public health investigation that was conducted, are discussed.

"The Association between Warning Label Requirements and Cigarette Smoking Prevalence by Education-Findings from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) The Guidelines for the implementation of Article 11 of the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) require that cigarette health warning labels should include pictures and take up 50% or more of the principal display area. This study examined how the association between large pictorial warnings, those covering â¥50% of the front and back of the package, and the prevalence of cigarette smoking varies by educational attainment. We pooled individual-level tobacco use data from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in 18 countries between 2008 and 2013 and linked them with warning label requirements during the same period from the MPOWER database and reports regarding warnings. The respondents ' self-reported exposure to warnings was examined according to education. Logistic regressions were further employed to analyze education- specific associations between large pictorial warnings and smoking prevalence, and whether such association differed by education was examined using an interaction test. At the time of the survey, eight out of 18 countries had imposed graphic warning labels that covered â¥50% of the package. These warnings were associated with a 10.0% (OR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.97; p â¤ 0.01) lower cigarette smoking prevalence among adults with less than a secondary education or no formal education, but not among respondents with at least a secondary education. Less educated respondents were also less likely to be exposed to warnings in all 18 countries. The association between strong warnings and lower smoking prevalence among less educated respondents could be greater if their exposure to warnings increases. Prominent pictorial warning labels can potentially reduce health disparities resulting from smoking across different education levels.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mother - Infant Emotion Regulation at Three Months: The Role of Maternal Anxiety, Depression and Parenting Stress While the association between anxiety and postpartum depression is well known, few studies have investigated the relationship between these two states and parenting stress. Furthermore, a number of studies have found that postpartum depression affects mother - infant emotion regulation, but there has been only one study on anxiety and emotion regulation and no studies at all on parenting stress and emotion regulation. Therefore, the primary aim of our study is to identify, in a community sample of 71 mothers, the relationship between maternal depression, anxiety, and parenting stress. The second aim is to examine the relationship between anxiety, postpartum depression, and parenting stress and mother - infant emotion regulation assessed at 3 months. Mother - infant interaction was coded with a modified version of the Infant Caregiver and Engagement Phases (ICEP) using a microanalytic approach. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) were administered to the mothers to assess depression, anxiety, and parenting stress, respectively. Analysis revealed correlations between anxiety and depression, showing that parenting stress is associated with both states. In a laboratory observation, depression was correlated with both negative maternal states and negative dyadic matches as well as infant positive / mother negative mismatches; anxiety was correlated with both negative maternal states and infant negative states as well as mismatches involving one of the partners having a negative state. Multiple regression analysis showed that anxiety is a greater predictor than depression of less adequate styles of mother - infant emotion regulation. Parenting stress was not shown to predict such regulation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Trans-kingdom small RNA transfer during host-pathogen interactions: The case of P. falciparum and erythrocytes This review focuses on the role of trans-kingdom movement of small RNA (sRNA) molecules between parasites, particularly Plasmodium falciparum, and their respective host cells. While the intercellular transfer of sRNAs within organisms is well recognized, recent studies illustrate many examples of trans-kingdom sRNA exchange within the context of host-parasite interactions. These interactions are predominantly found in the transfer of host sRNAs between erythrocytes and the invading P. falciparum, as well as other host cell types. In addition, parasite - encoded sRNAs can also be transferred to host cells to evade the immune system. The transport of these parasite sRNAs in the body fluids of the host may also offer means to detect and monitor the parasite infection. These isolated examples may only represent the tip of the iceberg in which the transfer of sRNA between host and parasites is a critical aspect of host-pathogen interactions. In addition, the levels of these sRNAs and their speed of transfer may vary dramatically under different contexts to push the biologic equilibrium toward the benefit of hosts vs. parasites. Therefore, these sRNA transfers may offer potential strategies to detect, prevent or treat parasite infections. Here, we review a brief history of the discovery of host erythrocyte sRNAs, their transfers and interactions in the context of P. falciparum infection. We also provide examples and discuss the functional significance of the reciprocal transfer of parasite - encoded sRNAs into hosts. These understandings of sRNA exchanges are put in the context of their implications for parasite pathogenesis, host defenses and the evolution of host polymorphisms driven by host interactions with these parasites.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Low intensity sprint training with blood flow restriction improves 100 m dash We investigated the effects of practical blood flow restriction (pBFR) of leg muscles during sprint training on the 100 m dash time in well-trained sport students. Participants performed 6x100 m sprints at 60-70% of their maximal 100 m sprinting speed twice a week for 6 weeks, either with (IG; n=12) or without pBFR (CG; n=12). The 100 m dash time significantly decreased more in the IG (-0.38Â±0.24 s) than in the CG (-0.16Â±0.17 s). The muscle thickness of the rectus femoris increased only in the IG, while no group by time interactions were found for the muscle thickness of the biceps femoris and the biceps brachii. The maximal isometric force, measured using a leg press, did not change in either group. However, the rate of force development improved in the IG. Growth hormone, testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1, and cortisol concentrations did not significantly differ between both groups at any measurement time point (pre, 1 min, 20 min, 120 min, and 24 h after the six all-out sprints of the first training session). The muscle damage marker h-FABP increased significantly more in the CG than in the IG. The pBFR improved the 100 m dash time significantly more than low - intensity sprint interval training alone. Other noted benefits of training with pBFR were a decreased level of muscle damage, a greater increase of the rectus femoris muscle thickness, and a higher rate of force development. However, the tested hormones were unable to explain the additional beneficial effects.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Personalized axillary dissection: the number of excised lymph nodes of nodal-positive breast cancer patients has no significant impact on relapse-free and overall survival Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for the staging of clinically node-negative breast cancer patients (BCP), demonstrating equivalent survival to ALND while resulting in reduced morbidity. ALND has remained the standard of care for the majority of BCP with clinical axillary metastases or metastases found on SLN biopsy. More recently, it is debated whether ALND could be avoided not only in SLN - negative BCP but also in selected SLN - positive disease or even in all patients. This analysis of pN+ BCP shows the impact of the number of excised lymph nodes on RFS and OAS adjusted by age, tumor size, intrinsic subtypes and adjuvant systemic therapy. In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we investigated data from 2992 pN+ primary BCP recruited from 17 participating certified breast cancer centers in Germany between 2001 and 2008 within the BRENDA study group. The median number of excised lymph nodes was 17. The number of excised lymph nodes was neither significant for RFS (p = 0.085) nor for OAS (p = 0.285). Adjustments were made for age, tumor size and intrinsic subtypes. The most important significant parameters for RFS were intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p < 0.001) and for OAS age (p < 0.001) and intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in RFS and OAS in any subgroup stratified by the number of excised lymph nodes. Only for T3 / T4 tumors, there is a very small significant advantage of ALND for RFS but not for OAS. After adjusting in addition by guideline adherence of adjuvant systemic therapy (AST), intrinsic subtypes and guideline-adherent AST are the most important significant (p < 0.001) parameters for RFS and OAS. The number of excised lymph nodes of pN+ BCP neither correlates with RFS nor with OAS. Survival of pN+ BCP is primarily determined by the biology and the guideline-adherent AST based on the corresponding intrinsic subtypes. These results support the omission of a radical ALND at least for pN+ patients scheduled for breast-conserving surgery (not mastectomy), provided they receive whole breast irradiation and guideline-adherent AST.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"BMI, Body Image, Emotional Well-Being and Weight-Control Behaviors in Urban African American Adolescents While urban African American adolescents face significant health disparities associated with overweight and obesity that follow them into adulthood; there is limited data on body image, emotional well-being, and weight control behaviors in this population to design effective public health interventions. This study was designed to understand the association of weight status to adolescent weight control, body image, and emotional well-being responses, in African American high school students. The study cohort consisted of 776 students, mean age 15.8 years (Â±1.2). Data from Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) student surveys and anthropometric studies were collected at School-Based Health Centers. Associations between adolescent responses on the GAPS and body mass index (BMI) status (healthy weight: 5th to less than 85th percentile, overweight: 85th to less than 95th percentile, obese: 95th percentile or greater) were estimated using logistic regression and dose- response plots. There were statistically significant associations between BMI category and weight control (ranging from a mean 5.18 to 7.68 odds of obesity) and body image (3.40 to 13.26 odds of obesity) responses. Responses to weight control and body image questions exhibited a dose-response for odds of overweight and obesity. Feelings of depressed mood were associated with obesity (1.47 times the odds of obesity compared to students who did not endorse depressed mood; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.13) but not overweight status. Overweight and obese urban African American adolescents are more likely to screen positively on weight control risk behaviors and negative body image questions than their normal weight peers. The weight control and body image measures on the GAPS may provide information to identify youth in need of services and those motivated for brief school-based weight control interventions.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Recurrent noncoding regulatory mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma The contributions of coding mutations to tumorigenesis are relatively well known; however, little is known about somatic alterations in noncoding DNA. Here we describe GECCO (Genomic Enrichment Computational Clustering Operation) to analyze somatic noncoding alterations in 308 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) and identify commonly mutated regulatory regions. We find recurrent noncoding mutations to be enriched in PDA pathways, including axon guidance and cell adhesion, and newly identified processes, including transcription and homeobox genes. We identified mutations in protein binding sites correlating with differential expression of proximal genes and experimentally validated effects of mutations on expression. We developed an expression modulation score that quantifies the strength of gene regulation imposed by each class of regulatory elements, and found the strongest elements were most frequently mutated, suggesting a selective advantage. Our detailed single-cancer analysis of noncoding alterations identifies regulatory mutations as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic markers, and suggests new mechanisms for tumor evolution.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Perspectives on cardiovascular effects of incretin -based drugs: From bedside to bench, return trip Recently, cardiovascular outcome trials with glucose -lowering drugs used in type 2 diabetes mellitus, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), liraglutide and semaglutide, showed a reduction in cardiovascular events, which had not been observed in trials with other incretin -based drugs, such as lixisenatide or with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i). Mechanisms underlying the observed cardiovascular differences between DPP4i and GLP1-RA, and across individual GLP1-RA are poorly understood. This review is aimed at collecting and summarizing available evidence from experimental and mechanistic studies on the action of GLP1-RA and DPP4i on the cardiovascular system, both deriving from clinical and pre-clinical sources. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials are interpreted on the basis of the experimental preclinical data available, paying particular attention to the heart failure results, and suggesting some novel intriguing hypotheses to explain some of the unexpected findings of cardioprotection of incretin -based drugs. In particular, we discuss the possible contribution to the incretin cardiovascular effects of a direct cardiac action of GLP-1 metabolites through GLP-1 receptor -independent pathways, and of DPP4 substrates other than GLP-1.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mapping mitochondrial heteroplasmy in a Leydig tumor by laser capture micro-dissection and cycling temperature capillary electrophoresis The growth of tumor cells is accompanied by mutations in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes creating marked genetic heterogeneity. Tumors also contain non-tumor cells of various origins. An observed somatic mitochondrial mutation would have occurred in a founding cell and spread through cell division. Micro-anatomical dissection of a tumor coupled with assays for mitochondrial point mutations permits new insights into this growth process. More generally, the ability to detect and trace, at a histological level, somatic mitochondrial mutations in human tissues and tumors, makes these mutations into markers for lineage tracing. A tumor was first sampled by a large punch biopsy and scanned for any significant degree of heteroplasmy in a set of sequences containing known mutational hotspots of the mitochondrial genome. A heteroplasmic tumor was sliced at a 12 Î¼m thickness and placed on membranes. Laser capture micro-dissection was used to take 25000 Î¼m(2) subsamples or spots. After DNA amplification, cycling temperature capillary electrophoresis (CTCE) was used on the laser captured samples to quantify mitochondrial mutant fractions. Of six testicular tumors studied, one, a Leydig tumor, was discovered to carry a detectable degree of heteroplasmy for two separate point mutations: a C â T mutation at bp 64 and a T â C mutation found at bp 152. From this tumor, 381 spots were sampled with laser capture micro-dissection. The ordered distribution of spots exhibited a wide range of fractions of the mutant sequences from 0 to 100% mutant copies. The two mutations co-distributed in the growing tumor indicating they were present on the same genome copies in the founding cell. Laser capture micro-dissection of sliced tumor samples coupled with CTCE -based point mutation assays provides an effective and practical means to obtain maps of mitochondrial mutational heteroplasmy within human tumors.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Avulsions of Triceps Brachii: associated injuries and surgical treatment; a case series This study reports the clinical presentations, intra -operative findings, type of the treatments, outcome of the treatment and specially associated injuries in patients with the avulsion of the distal end of the triceps brachii (TB) tendon. We studied 6 patients with rupture or avulsion of the distal end of the TB tendon. The medical records, imaging files, clinical outcomes at the final follow up visit were reviewed. The clinical outcomes were assessed by Mayo Elbow Score at the final follow-up visit. All patients were male, 4 of them having injury in the left hand as the non-dominant hand. Mean age of them was 34.5 years. All cases had small bony fleck in the posterior of elbow in lateral radiograph. Three patients had associated injuries -including intra-articular fractures and medial collateral ligament rupture. In one case V-Y plasty of the distal TB was done. In 4 patients the results of surgery were excellent, one was good and one was fair.

"Study of Safety Evaluation in Dispensing of Medicines - Analysis of Relationship between Dispensing Error Rate, Inspecting Error Rate, and Malpractice Rate In this study, we established a methodology to calculate the rate of overlooking a dispensing error (inspecting error rate) as a new index for the purpose of determining dispensing error and malpractice rates. Using data obtained from analyses of these error rates at our and two other hospitals, an inspecting error rate was calculated for each institution. Our results showed that inspecting errors occurred at a frequency 3-5 times greater as compared to dispensing errors at each of the examined hospitals. We concluded that construction of a higher quality safety management system would be enabled by incorporation of an inspecting error rate as a new index to evaluate medical safety in regard to dispensing of medicines and managing inspection accuracy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The efficiency and safety of trastuzumab for advanced gastric and gastroesophageal cancer: a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials A meta-analysis was performed to examine the efficiency and safety of trastuzumab in patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal cancer (AGC). By searching multiple databases from 1990 to March 2016, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which compared the effect of trastuzumab - combined chemotherapy (TC) versus chemotherapy alone (CT) in gastric cancer would be included. Five RCTs with a total of 875 patients were included. Trastuzumab can improve the overall survival (OS) rate, progression-free survival (PFS), one-year survival rate, two-year survival rate and overall response rate (ORR) of patients with AGC. There were no difference between the two arms in terms of grade 3 / 4 adverse effects, such as vomiting, nausea, neutropenia, thrombocytopaenia and anemia. Diarrhea increased in TC group. Trastuzumab can significantly improve the survival rate, PFS, ORR of patients with AGC. It is safe and feasible and can be tolerated.

"Three-Dimensional HyCoSy With Perfluoropropane-Albumin Microspheres as Contrast Agents and Normal Saline Injections Into the Pelvic Cavity for Morphological Assessment of the Fallopian Tube in Infertile Women To apply the three-dimensional (3D) hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) with perfluoropropane-albumin microspheres as contrast agents and normal saline injections into the pelvic cavity for assessment of the tubal patency and adhesions of fimbrial parts. Fifty-five infertile female patients were recruited to undergo 3D HyCoSy with normal saline injected into the pelvic cavity, in which the tubal patency was observed by visualizing the spillage of contrast agents from the fimbriae, and the fimbrial adhesion was confirmed by the finger-like projections of the fimbriae and their floating and moving status. Of the 55 patients, bilateral tubal patency was observed in 44 (80.0%), unilateral tubal patency and the other partial occlusion in 7 (12.7%), unilateral partial occlusion and the other complete occlusion in 3 (5.4%), and bilateral complete occlusion in 1 (1.8%). The fimbrial parts were observed in 105 fallopian tubes, among which 101 were seen with the finger-like fimbriae floated and moved in the pelvic cavity, whereas 4 tubes were not because of adhesion to the pelvic cavity (n = 3) or the ovary and intestine (n = 1). More than three visible, quite long, and distributed evenly finger-like projection s were present for the patent fimbrial parts; however, fewer, flat, and not evenly distributed finger-like projection s were present for the adhesive tubes. No serious complications occurred during or after this procedure. Combination of 3D HyCoSy with normal saline injected into the pelvic cavity may be a feasible and safe procedure to assess tubal patency and adhesions of the fimbrial parts.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Aging-related impairments of hippocampal mossy fibers synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells The network interaction between the dentate gyrus and area CA3 of the hippocampus is responsible for pattern separation, a process that underlies the formation of new memories, and which is naturally diminished in the aged brain. At the cellular level, aging is accompanied by a progression of biochemical modifications that ultimately affects its ability to generate and consolidate long-term potentiation. Although the synapse between dentate gyrus via the mossy fibers (MFs) onto CA3 neurons has been subject of extensive studies, the question of how aging affects the MF-CA3 synapse is still unsolved. Extracellular and whole-cell recordings from acute hippocampal slices of aged Wistar rats (34 Â± 2 months old) show that aging is accompanied by a reduction in the interneuron -mediated inhibitory mechanisms of area CA3. Several MF -mediated forms of short-term plasticity, MF long-term potentiation and at least one of the critical signaling cascades necessary for potentiation are also compromised in the aged brain. An analysis of the spontaneous glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid -mediated currents on CA3 cells reveal a dramatic alteration in amplitude and frequency of the nonevoked events. CA3 cells also exhibited increased intrinsic excitability. Together, these results demonstrate that aging is accompanied by a decrease in the GABAergic inhibition, reduced expression of short - and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity, and increased intrinsic excitability.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Fabrication and modelling of fractal, biomimetic, micro and nano-topographical surfaces Natural surface topographies are often self-similar with hierarchical features at the micro and nanoscale, which may be mimicked to overcome modern tissue engineering and biomaterial design limitations. Specifically, a cell's microenvironment within the human body contains highly optimised, fractal topographical cues, which directs precise cell behaviour. However, recreating biomimetic, fractal topographies in vitro is not a trivial process and a number of fabrication methods have been proposed but often fail to precisely control the spatial resolution of features at different lengths scales and hence, to provide true biomimetic properties. Here, we propose a method of accurately reproducing the self-similar, micro and nanoscale topography of a human biological tissue into a synthetic polymer through an innovative fabrication process. The biological tissue surface was characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain spatial data in X, Y and Z, which was converted into a grayscale 'digital photomask'. As a result of maskless grayscale optical lithography followed by modified deep reactive ion etching and replica molding, we were able to accurately reproduce the fractal topography of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Characterisation using AFM at three different length scales revealed that the nano and micro-topographical features, in addition to the fractal dimension, of native ADM were reproduced in PDMS. In conclusion, it has been shown that the fractal topography of biological surfaces can be mimicked in synthetic materials using the novel fabrication process outlined, which may be applied to significantly enhance medical device biocompatibility and performance.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A novel assay to measure tertiary and quaternary amines in wastewater: An indicator for NDMA wastewater precursors This study examined the potential of using a novel bulk amine assay as an approximation for the tertiary and quaternary amine load in wastewaters and surface water samples, and this approximation was compared to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential using chloramines. An existing colorimetric method was examined and optimized for the detection of amines in environmental water samples. The method consists of liquid-liquid extraction followed by a catalyzed reaction to form a yet- undefined product that is known to be both a strong chromophore and fluorophore. Previous work verified that this reaction was effectively catalyzed by a number of compounds containing tertiary and quaternary amine moieties. Many tertiary and quaternary compounds are also efficient producers of NDMA under chloramination conditions, and a linear correlation was consequently derived from the bulk amine signals vs. NDMA formation potential in various wastewater samples (R(2) = 0.74; n = 24; p-value < 0.05). The results provide evidence that approximately 2% of the tertiary and quaternary amines measured can form NDMA and an estimated 0.01-1.3% of nitrogen in dissolved organic nitrogen originates from these bulk amines. The normalization of NDMA concentration by the amine measurement revealed that ozone effectively destroyed those tertiary and quaternary amine structures more likely to form NDMA in treated wastewater samples. This bulk amine assay illustrates that proxy measurements of tertiary and quaternary amines can be linked to the NDMA formation potential of a given sample, and this approach may prove useful as a characterizing tool for NDMA precursors in wastewater.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A coarse-grained model for assisting the investigation of structure and dynamics of large nucleic acids by ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry (IMS-MS) is a rapidly emerging tool for the investigation of nucleic acid structure and dynamics. IMS-MS determinations can provide valuable information regarding alternative topologies, folding intermediates, and conformational heterogeneities, which are not readily accessible to other analytical techniques. The leading strategies for data interpretation rely on computational and experimental approaches to correctly assign experimental observations to putative structures. A very effective strategy involves the application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the structure of the analyte molecule, calculate its collision cross section (CCS), and then compare this computational value with the corresponding experimental data. While this approach works well for small nucleic acid species, analyzing larger nucleic acids of biological interest is hampered by the computational cost associated with capturing their extensive structure and dynamics in all-atom detail. In this report, we describe the implementation of a coarse graining (CG) approach to reduce the cost of the computational methods employed in the data interpretation workflow. Our framework employs a five-bead model to accurately represent each nucleotide in the nucleic acid structure. The beads are appropriately parameterized to enable the direct calculation of CCS values from CG models, thus affording the ability to pursue the analysis of larger, highly dynamic constructs. The validity of this approach was successfully confirmed by the excellent correlation between the CCS values obtained in parallel by all-atom and CG workflows.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Association between XRCC1 and ERCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the efficacy of concurrent radiochemotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in X-ray repair cross-complementing 1-399 (XRCC1-399) or excision repair cross-complementation group 1-118 (ERCC1-118) and the short-term efficacy of radiochemotherapy, tumor metastasis and relapse, as well as the survival time in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). TaqMan probe-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was conducted to examine the levels of XRCC1-399 and ERCC1-118 SNPs in the peripheral blood of 50 patients with pathologically confirmed ESCC. In addition, the associations between different genotypes and short-term therapeutic efficacy [the complete remission (CR) rate], tumor metastasis and relapse, as well as the survival time following concurrent radiochemotherapy, were determined. A total of 50 ESCC patients who received concurrent radiochemotherapy were enrolled. It was found that the short-term therapeutic efficacy (CR rate) was higher in the group of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of XRCC1-399 (A / A genotype) than in the group of patients without the XRCC1-399 mutation (G / G genotype). In addition, the CR rate was significantly increased in patients carrying one or two ERCC1-118 C alleles (C / C or C / T genotype) compared with patients lacking the C allele (T / T genotype). The differences were statistically significant (A / A vs. G / G, P=0.014; T T vs. C / T + C / C, P=0.040). During the follow-up period, the group of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of XRCC1-399 (A / A genotype) exhibited a markedly reduced risk of metastasis and relapse compared with the group of patients carrying non-mutated XRCC1-399 (G / G genotype; P=0.031). By contrast, ERCC1-118 SNP was not associated with the risk of metastasis and recurrence (P>0.05). The combined results of univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the SNP in ERCC1-118 was closely associated with survival time. The mean survival time was significantly prolonged in patients carrying 1 or 2 C alleles (C / C or C / T genotype) compared with patients lacking the C allele (T / T genotype) [T / T vs. C / C, HR =12.96, 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.08-54.61, P<0.001; T T vs. C / T + C / C, HR =11.71, 95% CI =3.06-44.83, P<0.001]. However, XRCC1-399 SNP had no effect on survival time (P>0.05). XRCCl-399 SNP was associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and tumor metastasis / relapse in ESCC patients who received the docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) regimen -based concurrent radiochemotherapy. By contrast, ERCC1-118 SNP was significantly associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and survival time in ESCC patients who received TP regimen -based concurrent radiochemotherapy.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Promoting lifestyle behaviour change and well-being in hospital patients: a pilot study of an evidence-based psychological intervention Lifestyle risk behaviours show an inverse social gradient, clustering in vulnerable groups. We designed and piloted an intervention to address barriers to lifestyle behaviour change among hospital patients. We designed our intervention using effective components of behaviour change interventions informed by psychological theory. Delivered by a health psychologist based at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, the 4-week intervention included detailed baseline assessment, personalized goal setting, psychological skills development, motivation support and referral to community services. Primary outcomes were feasibility and patient acceptability. We also evaluated changes to health and well-being. From 1 July 2013 to 31 September 2014, 686 patients were referred, 338 (49.3%) attended a first appointment and 172 (25.1%) completed follow-up. Furthermore, 72.1% of attenders were female with the median age 55 years and poor self-reported baseline health. After 4 weeks, self-efficacy, health and well-being scores significantly improved: 63% of lifestyle goals and 89% of health management goals were fully achieved; 58% of referrals to community lifestyle behaviour change services and 79% of referrals to other services (e.g. Citizen's Advice Bureau) were accepted; 99% were satisfied / very satisfied with the service. Our hospital-based intervention was feasible, acceptable and showed preliminary health and well-being gains.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Results of a Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Trial of a Hydrogen Peroxide -based Kit versus a Benzoyl Peroxide -based Kit in Mild-to-moderate Acne Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a novel hydrogen peroxide -based regimen versus a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen in mild-to-moderate acne. Methods: In this eight- week multicenter study, patients were randomized to either a hydrogen peroxide -based or a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen .The primary outcome measure of clinical response was assessed using the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) at baseline ,four weeks, and eight weeks. At Week 8, a patient self-satisfaction questionnaire was administered. Investigators were also queried at that time regarding assessment of tolerability and cosmetic acceptability. Tolerability was also measured at each visit. Results: Both treatment regimens were associated with improvement of GAGS score at Week 8 compared to baseline (p<0.0001). GAGS score did not differ significantly between the two regimens over the same period (p=0.7765). No significant adverse events were reported or observed in either treatment arm. Both patients and investigators found both regimens to be similarly effective and cosmetically acceptable. Conclusion: A novel hydrogen peroxide -based regimen was shown to be comparable in efficacy, safety, and cosmetic acceptability to a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen in the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Pleural malignant mesothelioma in dental laboratory technicians: A case series Asbestos was used in dentistry as a binder in periodontal dressings and as lining material for casting rings and crucible. However, until now, only one case of malignant mesothelioma with occupational exposure to asbestos in dental practice has been reported. We present 4 pleural mesotheliomas out of 5344 cases identified in Lombardy, Italy, in 2000-2014. Three men had been working as dental laboratory technicians, with asbestos exposure for 10, 34, and 4 years, and one woman had been helping her husband for 30 years in manufacturing dental prostheses. The men described the use of asbestos as a lining material for casting rings, while the woman was not able to confirm this use. We confirm the association of malignant mesothelioma with dental technician work. Dental technicians suffering from mesothelioma should be questioned about past occupational asbestos exposure.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Objective Assessment of Vergence after Treatment of Concussion - Related CI: A Pilot Study To evaluate changes in objective measures of disparity vergence after office-based vision therapy (OBVT) for concussion - related convergence insufficiency (CI) and determine the feasibility of using this objective assessment as an outcome measure in a clinical trial. This was a prospective, observational trial. All participants were treated with weekly OBVT with home reinforcement. Participants included two adolescents and three young adults with concussion - related, symptomatic CI. The primary outcome measure was average peak velocity for 4Â° symmetrical convergence steps. Other objective outcome measures of disparity vergence included time to peak velocity, latency, accuracy, settling time, and main sequence. We also evaluated saccadic eye movements using the same outcome measures. Changes in clinical measures (near point of convergence, positive fusional vergence at near, Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey [CISS] score) were evaluated. There were statistically significant and clinically meaningful changes in all clinical measures for convergence. Four of the five subjects met clinical success criteria. For the objective measures, we found a statistically significant increase in peak velocity, response accuracy to 4Â° symmetrical convergence and divergence step stimuli, and the main sequence ratio for convergence step stimuli. Objective saccadic eye movements (5 and 10Â°) appeared normal pre- OBVT and did not show any significant change after treatment. This is the first report of the use of objective measures of disparity vergence as outcome measures for concussion - related convergence insufficiency. These measures provide additional information that is not accessible with clinical tests about underlying physiological mechanisms leading to changes in clinical findings and symptoms. The study results also demonstrate that patients with concussion can tolerate the visual demands (over 200 vergence and versional eye movements) during the 25-minute testing time and suggest that these measures could be used in a large-scale randomized clinical trial of concussion - related CI as outcome measures.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Randomized Crossover Trial of Amoxapine Versus Vitamin B12 for Retrograde Ejaculation To compare the efficacy and safety of amoxapine and vitamin B12 for treating retrograde ejaculation (RE). Between May 2009 and November 2012, this open-label, randomized, crossover study enrolled 26 men suffering with RE at Department of Reproductive Medicine, Omori Hospital. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (n=13 each). The amoxapine - B12 group received amoxapine (50 mg daily for 4 weeks, orally) followed (after a 1- week washout period) by vitamin B12 (500 Î¼g three-times daily for 4 weeks). The B12 - amoxapine group received the opposite regimen. All pa-tients masturbated to ejaculation at least twice during each treatment period. The primary outcome was antegrade ejaculation of semen, as reported by the patient, on more than one occasion during either treatment period (defined as treatment success). Any adverse events were noted. Success rates were compared between treatments using Fisher's exact test. One patient (B12 - amoxapine group) withdrew for personal reasons (breakdown of marital relations); all other patients completed the study. Overall success rate was 88% (22/25). Success rate was higher for amoxapine than for vitamin B12 (80%, 20/25 vs 16%, 4/25; P<0.0001). 18 patients were responsive to amoxapine but not to vitamin B12, 2 patients were responsive to vitamin B12 but not amoxapine, 2 patients were responsive to both drugs, and 3 patients had no response to either drug. One patient (4%) reported sleepiness and 2 (8%) reported constipation while receiving amoxapine. No adverse events were reported during vitamin B12 treatment. Amoxapine may be an effective, safe and well-tolerated therapy for RE.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Scutellarin attenuates vasospasm through the Erk5 - KLF2 - eNOS pathway after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats Angiographic vasospasm, especially in the early phases (<72h) of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), is one of the major complications after an aneurysm rupture and is often the cause of delayed neurological deterioration. Scutellarin (SCU), a flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Erigeron breviscapus, has been widely accepted as an antioxidant, but the effect of SCU on vasospasm after SAH remains elusive. Endovascular perforation was conducted to induce SAH in Sprague-Dawley rats. Then, the underlying mechanism of the anti-vasospasm effect of SCU was investigated using a modified Garcia scale, India ink angiography, cross-sectional area analysis, immunohistochemistry staining and western blot. SCU (50Î¼M, 100mg/kg) alleviated angiographic vasospasm and improved neurological function 48h after SAH and enhanced the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at the intima of cerebral arteries. In addition, SCU upregulated the expression of phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase 5 (p-Erk5) and Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) at 48h after SAH. However, the effects of SCU were reversed by the Erk5 inhibitor XMD8-92. Our results indicate that SCU could attenuate vasospasm and neurological deficits via modulating the Erk5 - KLF2 - eNOS pathway after SAH, which may provide an experimental basis for the clinical use of SCU treatment in SAH patients.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Diabetic nephropathy as the cause of end-stage kidney disease reported on the medical evidence form CMS2728 at a single center Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) incidence due to Type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN) is 35-50%, according to the United States Renal Data System. Methods: A single- center, retrospective cohort study to determine incidence and diagnostic accuracy for Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD (Code 250.40) on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) Medical Evidence Report form (CMS2728) submitted at renal replacement therapy initiation. All patients â¥18 years of age with a CMS2728 submitted between 1 March 2006 and 31 March 2015 at a single academic military medical center (ESRD Network 5) were included. Medical records of those with a Code 250.40 diagnosis were reviewed to determine whether they met the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2007 criteria for DN. Results: ESRD incidence secondary to Type 2 DN was 18.7% (56/299 individual CMS2728 submissions over 9.09 years). In all, 12/56 (21.4%) did not meet KDOQI criteria for Type 2 DN. Although all had diabetes, those not meeting criteria had shorter disease duration (P = 0.007), were more likely to have active urine sediment (P = 0.006), and were less likely to have macroalbuminuria (P = 0.037) or retinopathy (P = 0.002) prior to ESRD. On exact logistic regression, retinopathy was significantly associated with KDOQI -predicted DN [odds ratio = 19.16 (confidence interval 2.76-223.7), P = 0.0009]. Conclusions: In this single- center cohort, 21.4% identified as having Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD were incorrectly assigned per KDOQI 2007 clinical criteria. If replicated in larger populations, this could have substantial implications regarding the epidemiology of ESRD in the USA.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Mesenchymal stem cells enhance the oncolytic effect of Newcastle disease virus in glioma cells and glioma stem cells via the secretion of TRAIL Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an avian paramyxovirus, which selectively exerts oncolytic effects in cancer cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to affect tumor growth and deliver anti-tumor agents to experimental glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we explored the effects of NDV - infected MSCs derived from different sources, on glioma cells and glioma stem cells (GSCs) and the mechanisms involved in their effects. The glioma cell lines (A172 and U87) and primary GSCs that were generated from GBM tumors were used in this study. MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue or umbilical cord were infected with NDV (MTH-68/H). The ability of these cells to deliver the virus to glioma cell lines and GSCs and the effects of NDV - infected MSCs on cell death and on the stemness and self-renewal of GSCs were examined. The mechanisms involved in the cytotoxic effects of the NDV - infected MSCs and their influence on the radiation sensitivity of GSCs were examined as well. NDV induced a dose-dependent cell death in glioma cells and a low level of apoptosis and inhibition of self-renewal in GSCs. MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose and umbilical cord that were infected with NDV delivered the virus to co-cultured glioma cells and GSCs. Conditioned medium of NDV - infected MSCs induced higher level of apoptosis in the tumor cells compared with the apoptosis induced by their direct infection with similar virus titers. These results suggest that factor(s) secreted by the infected MSCs sensitized the glioma cells to the cytotoxic effects of NDV. We identified TRAIL as a mediator of the cytotoxic effects of the infected MSCs and demonstrated that TRAIL synergized with NDV in the induction of cell death in glioma cells and GSCs. Moreover, conditioned medium of infected MSCs enhanced the sensitivity of GSCs to Î³-radiation. NDV - infected umbilical cord - derived MSCs may provide a novel effective therapeutic approach for targeting GSCs and GBM and for sensitizing these tumors to Î³-radiation.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Diabetes and breast cancer mortality in Black women Breast cancer mortality is higher in Black women than in White women. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is also higher, yet data on whether diabetes affects breast cancer mortality in this population are lacking. We investigated the relation of diabetes at the time of breast cancer diagnosis to breast cancer mortality in the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study. 1,621 Black women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 1995-2013 were followed by mailed questionnaires and searches of the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for diabetes in relation to breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, with adjustment for age, stage, treatment modality, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and body mass index. There were 368 deaths during follow-up, of which 273 were due to breast cancer. Breast cancer mortality was significantly increased in women who had been diagnosed with diabetes at least 5 years before breast cancer occurrence, HR 1.86 (95% CI 1.20-2.89), with elevations observed for both ER+ and ER- breast cancer. All-cause mortality was also higher in diabetics, with HRs of 1.54 (95% CI 1.12-2.07) overall and 2.26 (95% CI 1.62-3.15) for â¥5-year duration of diabetes relative to non-diabetics. Our results present the first solid evidence of a positive association of type 2 diabetes with breast cancer mortality in Black women. Given the higher prevalence and earlier onset of type 2 diabetes in Black women, it is likely that diabetes contributes to racial disparities in breast cancer mortality.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Gene Expression Profile in the Liver of Sheep Infected with Cystic Echinococcosis Cystic Echinococcosis (CE), caused by infection with the Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus), represents considerable health problems in both humans and livestock. Nevertheless, the genetic program that regulates the host response to E. granulosus infection is largely unknown. Previously, using microarray analysis, we found that the innate immunity played a vital role in the E. granulosus defense of the intestine tissue where E. granulosus first invaded. Subsequently, we turned our attention to investigating the molecular immune mechanism in its organ target, the liver, which is where the E. granulosus metacestodes are established and live for very long periods. In this work, the microarray-based methodology was used to study gene expression profiles in the liver of sheep infected with E. granulosus at 8 weeks post infection, corresponding to the early cystic established phase. A total of 6 female -1- year -old healthy Kazakh sheep were used for the experiments. Three Kazakh sheep were orally infected with E. granulosus eggs, and the others remained untreated and served as controls. Sheep were humanely euthanized and necropsized at 8 weeks post - infection (the early stage of cyst established). The microarray was used to detect differential hepatic gene expression between CE infection sheep and healthy controls at this time point. Real-time PCR was used to validate the microarray data. We found that E. granulosus infection induces 153 differentially expressed genes in the livers of infected sheep compared with healthy controls. Among them, 87 genes were up-regulated, and 66 genes were notably down-regulated. Functional analysis showed that these genes were associated with three major functional categories: (a) metabolism, (b) the immune system and (c) signaling and transport. Deeper analysis indicated that complement together with other genes associated with metabolism, played important roles in the defense of E. granulosus infection. The present study identified genes profiling in the liver tissue of E. granulosus infection in sheep.

"Choriocapillaris evaluation in choroideremia using optical coherence tomography angiography The choriocapillaris plays an important role in supporting the metabolic demands of the retina. Studies of the choriocapillaris in disease states with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) have proven insightful. However, image artifacts complicate the identification and quantification of the choriocapillaris in degenerative diseases such as choroideremia. Here, we demonstrate a supervised machine learning approach to detect intact choriocapillaris based on training with results from an expert grader. We trained a random forest classifier to evaluate en face structural OCT and OCTA information along with spatial image features. Evaluation of the trained classifier using previously unseen data showed good agreement with manual grading.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Effect of magnesium supplementation on depression status in depressed patients with magnesium deficiency: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial The aim of this study was to determine the effect of magnesium supplementation on the depression status of depressed patients suffering from magnesium deficiency. Sixty depressed people suffering from hypomagnesemia participated in this trial. The individuals were randomly categorized into two groups of 30 members; one receiving two 250-mg tablets of magnesium oxide (MG) daily and the other receiving placebo (PG) for 8 wk. The Beck Depression Inventory-II was conducted and the concentration of serum magnesium was measured. At the end of intervention, 88.5% of the MG and 48.1% of the PG (P = 0.002) had a normal level of magnesium. The mean changes of serum magnesium were significantly different across the two groups. After the intervention, the mean Beck score significantly declined. However, in the MG, this reduction was more significant than in the PG (P = 0.02), so that the mean changes in this group experienced 15.65 Â± 8.9 reduction, but in the PG, it declined by 10.40 Â± 7.9. Daily consumption of 500 mg magnesium oxide tablets for â¥8 wk by depressed patients suffering from magnesium deficiency leads to improvements in depression status and magnesium levels. Therefore, assessment of the magnesium serum and resolving this deficiency positively influence the treatment of depressed patients.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"A novel method for interactive multi-objective dose-guided patient positioning In intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3D in-room imaging data is typically utilized for accurate patient alignment on the basis of anatomical landmarks. In the presence of non-rigid anatomical changes, it is often not obvious which patient position is most suitable. Thus, dose -guided patient alignment is an interesting approach to use available in-room imaging data for up-to-date dose calculation, aimed at finding the position that yields the optimal dose distribution. This contribution presents the first implementation of dose -guided patient alignment as multi-criteria optimization problem. User-defined clinical objectives are employed for setting up a multi-objective problem. Using pre-calculated dose distributions at a limited number of patient shifts and dose interpolation, a continuous space of Pareto-efficient patient shifts becomes accessible. Pareto sliders facilitate interactive browsing of the possible shifts with real-time dose display to the user. Dose interpolation accuracy is validated and the potential of multi-objective dose-guided positioning demonstrated for three head and neck (H&N) and three prostate cancer patients. Dose-guided positioning is compared to replanning for all cases. A delineated replanning CT served as surrogate for in-room imaging data. Dose interpolation accuracy was high. Using a [Formula: see text] dose difference criterion, a median pass-rate of 95.7% for H&N and 99.6% for prostate cases was determined in a comparison to exact dose calculations. For all patients, dose-guided positioning allowed to find a clinically preferable dose distribution compared to bony anatomy based alignment. For all H&N cases, mean dose to the spared parotid glands was below [Formula: see text] (up to [Formula: see text] with bony alignment) and clinical target volume (CTV) [Formula: see text] above 99.1% (compared to 95.1%). For all prostate patients, CTV [Formula: see text] was above 98.9% (compared to 88.5%) and [Formula: see text] to the rectum below [Formula: see text] (compared to 56.1%). Replanning yielded improved results for the H&N cases. For the prostate cases, differences to dose-guided positioning were minor.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

"Increased childhood body mass index is associated with young adult serum uric acid levels: a linkage study from Japan Growth pattern in early life is one of the most important factors affecting the pathogenesis of metabolic-associated diseases. The associations between serum uric acid (SUA) and hypertension, kidney disease, and coronary heart disease have been recognized. We investigated the association between increased body mass index (BMI) during childhood and adult SUA levels in Japan .MethodsWe included 298 children with health examination data between 1981 and 2002 who had also undergone physical examinations after reaching early adulthood (approximately 27 years old). Subjects were divided into sex-specific tertiles based on the difference in their BMI (DBMI) over a 6- year period (6-12 years of age). The association between the three DBMI groups and SUA in adults was analyzed. The predicted average SUA level in adults from the high DBMI group was 5.32 mg/dl after adjustment for related factors in a combined sex analysis. This was significantly higher than among the low DBMI group. Excessive BMI increases during childhood led to young adult SUA elevation even after adjusting for several factors. Lifestyle in early life may be a strong predictor of future uric acid metabolism and the resulting disease risk.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Serum levels of genomic DNA of Î±1(I) collagen are elevated in scleroderma patients Recent studies have indicated that various nucleic acids are present in human sera, and attracted attention for their potential as novel disease markers in many human diseases. In this study, we tried to evaluate the possibility that DNA and RNA of collagens exist in human sera, and determined whether their serum levels can be useful biomarkers in scleroderma patients. The RNA or DNA of collagens were purified from sera, and detected by polymerase chain reaction or quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among approximately 18 360 bases of full-length Î±1(I) collagen DNA, various regions were detected by polymerase chain reaction in human sera. However, Î±2(I) collagen DNA, Î±1(I) collagen RNA or Î±2(I) collagen RNA were not detectable. Î±1(I) Collagen DNA in sera was quantitative using our method. The levels of serum Î±1(I) collagen DNA were significantly increased in scleroderma patients compared with healthy control subjects or systemic lupus erythematosus patients. According to the receiver-operator curve analysis, serum Î±1(I) collagen DNA levels were shown to be effective as a diagnostic marker of scleroderma. Furthermore, when we determined the association of serum Î±1(I) collagen DNA levels with clinical / laboratory features in scleroderma patients, those with elevated Î±1(I) collagen DNA levels showed significantly higher prevalence of pitting scars / ulcers. In summary, elevation of serum Î±1(I) collagen DNA levels in scleroderma patients may be useful as the diagnostic marker, reflecting the presence of vasculopathy.

"Renal Function and the Risk of Stroke and Bleeding in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: An Observational Cohort Study We sought to determine the risk of stroke / thromboembolism and bleeding associated with reduced renal function in patients with atrial fibrillation and the risk of stroke and bleeding associated with warfarin treatment in specific estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) groups. We conducted a register-based cohort study and included patients discharged with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from 1997 to 2011 with available eGFR. A total of 17 349 patients were identified with eGFR available at baseline. All levels of lower eGFR were associated with higher risk of stroke / thromboembolism and bleeding. Use of warfarin was associated with higher bleeding risk in all eGFR groups; hazard ratios 1.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-1.56), 1.26 (95% CI, 1.14-1.40), 1.18 (95% CI, 1.07-1.31), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.87-1.42), 2.01 (95% CI, 1.14-3.54) in patients with eGFR â¥90, 60 to 89, 30 to 59, 15 to 29, and <15 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively.

"Prognostic implications of the intrinsic molecular subtypes in male breast cancer Intrinsic molecular subtyping has been widely used in female breast cancer, and it has proven its significance. In this article, we aimed to study the intrinsic subtypes of male breast cancer (MBC) in correlation with clinicopathological features. We retrospectively identified 130 MBC cases from 2004 to 2013. Intrinsic molecular subtypes were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). From a total of 130 MBC cases, 45.4% of tumors were luminal A subtype, 44.6% were luminal B, 5% were HER2 positive and 5% were triple negative tumors. There were statistically significant differences between different IHC intrinsic subtypes regarding tumor size (p=0.001), estrogen receptor (ER) status (p=0.001), progesterone receptor (PR) status (p=0.001), HER2 status (p=0.001) and Ki67 proliferation index (p=0.001).

"Supplementary Health Insurance from the consumer point of view: Are Israelis consumers doing an informed rational choice when purchasing Supplementary Health Insurance? The National Health Insurance Law in Israel ensures basic health basket eligibility for all its citizens. A supplemental health insurance plan (SHIP) is offered for an additional fee. Over the years, the percentage of supplemental insurance's holders has risen considerably, ranking among the highest in OECD countries. The assumption that consumers implement an informed rational choice based on relevant information is doubtful. Are consumers sufficiently well informed to make market processes work well? To examine perspectives, preferences and knowledge of Israelis in relation to SHIP. A telephone survey was conducted with a representative sample of the Israeli adult population. 703 interviews were completed. The response rate was 50.3%. 85% of the sample reported possessing SHIP. This survey found that most of the Israeli public parched additional insurance coverage however did not show a significant knowledge about the benefits provided by the supplementary insurance, at least in the three measurements used in this study. The scope of SHIP acquisition is very broad and cannot be explained in economic terms alone. Acquiring SHIP became a default option rather than an active decision.

"Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction Femoral Tunnel Accuracy: Relationship to Disease - Specific Quality of Life Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is a procedure aimed to reestablish the checkrein to lateral patellar translation in patients with symptomatic patellofemoral instability. Correct femoral tunnel position is thought to be crucial to successful MPFL reconstruction, but the accuracy of this statement in terms of patient outcomes has not been tested. To assess the accuracy of femoral tunnel placement in an MPFL reconstruction cohort and to determine the correlation between tunnel accuracy and a validated disease - specific, patient -reported quality-of-life outcome measure. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Between June 2008 and February 2014, a total of 206 subjects underwent an MPFL reconstruction. Lateral radiographs were measured to determine the accuracy of the femoral tunnel by measuring the distance from the center of the femoral tunnel to the SchÃ¶ttle point. Banff Patella Instability Instrument (BPII) scores were collected a mean 24 months postoperatively. A total of 155 (79.5%) subjects had adequate postoperative lateral radiographs and complete BPII scores. The mean duration of follow-up (Â± SD) was 24.4 Â± 8.2 months (range, 12-74 months). Measurement from the center of the femoral tunnel to the SchÃ¶ttle point resulted in 143 (92.3%) tunnel s being categorized as "" good "" or "" ideal ."" There were 8 failures in the cohort, none of which occurred in malpositioned tunnels. The mean distance from the center of the MPFL tunnel to the center of the SchÃ¶ttle point was 5.9 Â± 4.2 mm (range, 0.5-25.9 mm). The mean postoperative BPII score was 65.2 Â± 22.5 (range, 9.2-100). Pearson r correlation demonstrated no statistically significant relationship between accuracy of femoral tunnel position and BPII score (r = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.08). There was no evidence of a correlation between the accuracy of MPFL reconstruction femoral tunnel in relation to the SchÃ¶ttle point and disease - specific quality-of-life scores. Graft failure was not related to femoral tunnel placement.

"Association between Leukoaraiosis and Poor Outcome is not due to Reperfusion Inefficiency after Intravenous Thrombolysis Leukoaraiosis (LA) is associated with structural and functional cerebrovascular impairment, which may compromise the capacity of ischemic tissue to maximize reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). We aimed to determine whether severe LA is correlated with reperfusion inefficiency, which contributes to infarct growth and poor functional outcome. We analyzed data from our consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients who had acquired baseline and 24-h follow-up diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging. Reperfusion was defined as reduction of â¥70 % of hypoperfusion lesion at 24 h from baseline. Severe LA was defined as Fazekas score 2 or 3 on FLAIR images. We investigated the relationship between severity of LA and reperfusion status. Multivariate statistical analysis was carried out for modeling the independent predictors of reperfusion, infarct growth, and functional outcome. Finally, 79 patients were included, among them 30 (37.97 %) had severe LA. Reperfusion was observed in 41 (51.89 %) patients, the proportion of reperfusion was very similar in patients with and without severe LA (53.33 vs 51.02 %, p = 1.000). Large artery occlusion was the only independent unfavorable predictor for reperfusion (OR = 0.202, 95 % confidence interval, 0.060-0.673; p = 0.014). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that severe LA was independently associated with infarct growth (standardized coefficients = 0.191, p = 0.040). Severe LA was also an independent predictor of poor outcome (mRS â¥ 3) (OR = 4.004, 95 % confidence interval, 1.267-12.656, p = 0.018) after adjusting for reperfusion and baseline severity of stroke. Severe LA was associated with infarct growth and poor outcome independent of reperfusion status, which may expand the notion that LA contributes the intrinsic vulnerability of brain tissue to acute ischemic insults. The burden of LA may not serve as an imaging indicator of reperfusion inefficiency after IVT for AIS patients.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Antiviral activities of selected antimalarials against dengue virus type 2 and Zika virus In a previous study, twelve antimalarial compounds, amodiaquine (AQ) and derivatives, were shown to have potent anti-dengue viral (DENV) activity by using the stable DENV2 Renilla luciferase reporter replicon expressing BHK-21 cells, infectivity (plaque), and the qRT-PCR assays. In this study, we performed molecular modeling on these compounds to determine their stereo-electronic properties required for optimal antiviral activity. Based on the similarity of calculated stereo-electronic profiles, specifically the electrostatic potential profiles of the compounds, and in silico screening of related compounds from literature, we identified three additional compounds, Quinacrine (QC), Mefloquine (MQ), and GSK369796. Analysis of their antiviral activities indicated that all three compounds have high anti-DENV activity in the DENV2 replicon expressing cells with EC50 values of 5.30 Â± 1.31 Î¼M (QC), 3.22 Â± 0.37 Î¼M (MQ), and 5.06 Â± 0.86 Î¼M (GSK369796). The infectivity assays revealed the EC50 values of 7.09 Â± 1.67 Î¼M (QC), 4.36 Â± 0.31 Î¼M (MQ) and 3.03 Â± 0.35 Î¼M (GSK369796). The mode of action of these compounds is through inhibition of autophagy, thereby affecting DENV2 replication. Moreover, these compounds also showed antiviral activity against the rapidly emerging Zika virus (ZIKV) with EC50 values of 2.27 Â± 0.14 Î¼M (QC), 3.95 Â± 0.21 Î¼M (MQ), and 2.57 Â± 0.09 Î¼M (GSK369796).",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"The role of P2X7 receptors in a rodent PCP - induced schizophrenia model P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) are ligand-gated ion channels sensitive to extracellular ATP. Here we examined for the first time the role of P2X7R in an animal model of schizophrenia. Using the PCP induced schizophrenia model we show that both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of P2X7Rs alleviate schizophrenia-like behavioral alterations. In P2rx7+/+ mice, PCP induced hyperlocomotion, stereotype behavior, ataxia and social withdrawal. In P2X7 receptor deficient mice (P2rx7-/-), the social interactions were increased, whereas the PCP induced hyperlocomotion and stereotype behavior were alleviated. The selective P2X7 receptor antagonist JNJ-47965567 partly replicated the effect of gene deficiency on PCP - induced behavioral changes and counteracted PCP - induced social withdrawal. We also show that PCP treatment upregulates and increases the functional responsiveness of P2X7Rs in the prefrontal cortex of young adult animals. The amplitude of NMDA evoked currents recorded from layer V pyramidal neurons of cortical slices were slightly decreased by both genetic deletion of P2rx7 and by JNJ-47965567. PCP induced alterations in mRNA expression encoding schizophrenia-related genes, such as NR2A, NR2B, neuregulin 1, NR1 and GABA Î±1 subunit were absent in the PFC of young adult P2rx7-/- animals. Our findings point to P2X7R as a potential therapeutic target in schizophrenia.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Genetic alterations in mesiodens as revealed by targeted next-generation sequencing and gene co-occurrence network analysis Mesiodens is the most common type of supernumerary tooth which includes a population prevalence of 0.15%-1.9%. Alongside evidence that the condition is heritable, mutations in single genes have been reported in few human supernumerary tooth cases. Gene sequencing methods in tradition way are time-consuming and labor-intensive, whereas next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are cost-effective for large samples and target sizes. We describe the application of a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics approach to samples from 17 mesiodens patients. Subjects were diagnosed on the basis of panoramic radiograph. A total of 101 candidate genes which were captured custom genes were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Multistep bioinformatics processing was performed including variant identification, base calling, and in silico analysis of putative disease - causing variants. Targeted capture identified 88 non-synonymous, rare, exonic variants involving 42 of the 101 candidate genes. Moreover, we investigated gene co-occurrence relationships between the genomic alterations and identified 88 significant relationships among 18 most recurrent driver alterations. Our search for co-occurring genetic alterations revealed that such alterations interact cooperatively to drive mesiodens. We discovered a gene co-occurrence network in mesiodens patients with functionally enriched gene groups in the sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), and wingless integrated (WNT) signaling pathways.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Tetrabromobisphenol A activates the hepatic interferon pathway in rats Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a widely used flame retardant in printed circuit boards, paper, and textiles. In a two-year study, TBBPA showed evidence of uterine tumors in female Wistar-Han rats and liver and colon tumors in B6C3F1 mice. In order to gain further insight into early gene and pathway changes leading to cancer, we exposed female Wistar Han rats to TBBPA at 0, 25, 250, or 1000mg/kg (oral gavage in corn oil, 5Ã/ week) for 13 weeks. Because at the end of the TBBPA exposure period, there were no treatment-related effects on body weights, liver or uterus lesions, and liver and uterine organ weights were within 10% of controls, only the high dose animals were analyzed. Analysis of the hepatic and uterine transcriptomes showed TBBPA -induced changes primarily in the liver (1000mg/kg), with 159 transcripts corresponding to 132 genes differentially expressed compared to controls (FDR=0.05). Pathway analysis showed activation of interferon (IFN) and metabolic networks. TBBPA induced few molecular changes in the uterus. Activation of the interferon pathway in the liver occurred after 13-weeks of TBBPA exposure, and with longer term TBBPA exposure this may lead to immunomodulatory changes that contribute to carcinogenic processes.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Repeated local emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a single hospital ward We recently reported a dramatic increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a Vietnamese hospital. This upsurge was associated with a specific oxa23 -positive clone that was identified by multilocus VNTR analysis. Here, we used whole-genome sequence analysis to dissect the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the ICU during 2009-2012. To provide historical context and distinguish microevolution from strain introduction, we compared these genomes with those of A. baumannii asymptomatic carriage and VAP isolates from this same ICU collected during 2003-2007. We identified diverse lineages co-circulating over many years. Carbapenem resistance was associated with the presence of oxa23, oxa40, oxa58 and ndm1 genes in multiple lineages. The majority of resistant isolates were oxa23 -positive global clone GC2; fine-scale phylogenomic analysis revealed five distinct GC2 sublineages within the ICU that had evolved locally via independent chromosomal insertions of oxa23 transposons. The increase in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was associated with transposon -mediated transmission of a carbapenemase gene, rather than clonal expansion or spread of a carbapenemase -harbouring plasmid. Additionally, we found evidence of homologous recombination creating diversity within the local GC2 population, including several events resulting in replacement of the capsule locus. We identified likely donors of the imported capsule locus sequences amongst the A. baumannii isolated on the same ward, suggesting that diversification was largely facilitated via reassortment and sharing of genetic material within the localized A. baumannii population.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Social cognition in schizophrenia: Factor structure of emotion processing and theory of mind Factor analytic studies examining social cognition in schizophrenia have yielded inconsistent results most likely due to the varying number and quality of measures. With the recent conclusion of Phase 3 of the Social Cognition Psychometric Evaluation (SCOPE) Study, the most psychometrically sound measures of social cognition have been identified. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to: 1) examine the factor structure of social cognition in schizophrenia through the utilization of psychometrically sound measures, 2) examine the stability of the factor structure across two study visits, 3) compare the factor structure of social cognition in schizophrenia to that in healthy controls, and 4) examine the relationship between the factors and relevant outcome measures including social functioning and symptoms. Results supported a one-factor model for the patient and healthy control samples at both visits. This single factor was significantly associated with negative symptoms in the schizophrenia sample and with social functioning in both groups at both study visits.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Compensatory and decompensatory alterations in cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) dynamics in hearts with diastolic dysfunction following aortic banding At the cellular level cardiac hypertrophy causes remodelling, leading to changes in ionic channel, pump and exchanger densities and kinetics. Previous studies have focused on quantifying changes in channels, pump s and exchangers without quantitatively linking these changes with emergent cellular scale functionality. Two biophysical cardiac cell models were created, parameterized and validated and are able to simulate electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in myocytes from control sham operated rats and aortic - banded rats exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The contribution of each ionic pathway to the calcium kinetics was calculated, identifying the L-type Ca(2+) channel and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase as the principal regulators of systolic and diastolic Ca(2+), respectively. Results show that the ability to dynamically change systolic Ca(2+), through changes in expression of key Ca(2+) modelling protein densities, is drastically reduced following the aortic banding procedure; however the cells are able to compensate Ca(2+) homeostasis in an efficient way to minimize systolic dysfunction. Elevated left ventricular afterload leads to myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, cellular remodelling and compromised calcium dynamics. At the cellular scale this remodelling of the ionic channels, pumps and exchangers gives rise to changes in the Ca(2+) transient. However, the relative roles of the underlying subcellular processes and the positive or negative impact of each remodelling mechanism are not fully understood. Biophysical cardiac cell models were created to simulate electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in myocytes from control rats (SHAM) and aortic - banded rats exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The model parameters and framework were validated and the fitted parameters demonstrated to be unique for explaining our experimental data. The contribution of each ionic pathway to the calcium kinetics was calculated, identifying the L-type Ca(2+) channel (LCC) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) -ATPase (SERCA) as the principal regulators of systolic and diastolic Ca(2+), respectively. In the aortic banding model, the sensitivity of systolic Ca(2+) to LCC density and diastolic Ca(2+) to SERCA density decreased by 16-fold and increased by 23%, respectively, relative to the SHAM model. The energy cost of ionic homeostasis is maintained across the two models. The models predict that changes in ionic pathway densities in compensated aortic banding rats maintain Ca(2+) function and efficiency. The ability to dynamically alter systolic function is significantly diminished, while the capacity to maintain diastolic Ca(2+) is moderately increased.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Rational use of rasburicase for the treatment and management of tumor lysis syndrome Purpose There is a lack of high-level evidence identifying meaningful outcomes and the optimal place in therapy of rasburicase in patients with, or at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize outcomes resulting from an institution-specific guideline emphasizing supportive care, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and lower doses of rasburicase. Methods In this retrospective chart review, we compared conservative rasburicase dosing, in accordance with newly developed UMHS tumor lysis syndrome guidelines, with aggressive rasburicase in adult patients (â¥ 18 years of age) with hematological or solid tumor malignancies, and a uric acid level between 8 and 15 mg/dL. The primary efficacy outcome assessed the difference in the proportion of patients achieving a uric acid level <8 mg/dL within 48 h using a one-sided noninferiority test. The principle safety outcomes analyzed included incidence of acute kidney injury and hemodialysis requirement. Results One hundred sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Within 48 h of an elevated uric acid level, treatment was successful in 97.03% of patients in the conservative group, as compared with 98.33% in the aggressive group (difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.33 to 5.93). Furthermore, there was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring hemodialysis (2.97% vs. 10.0%, p-value 0.079), or incidence of acute kidney injury (4.0% vs. 12.5%, p-value 1.00) between the treatment group and control group, respectively. Conclusions Conservative rasburicase use was noninferior to aggressive rasburicase use in patients with or at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
"Abnormal neural precursor cell regulation in the early postnatal Fragile X mouse hippocampus The regulation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) is indispensable for a properly functioning brain. Abnormalities in NPC proliferation, differentiation, survival, or integration have been linked to various neurological diseases including Fragile X syndrome. Yet, no studies have examined NPCs from the early postnatal Fragile X mouse hippocampus despite the importance of this developmental time point, which marks the highest expression level of FMRP, the protein missing in Fragile X, in the rodent hippocampus and is when hippocampal NPCs have migrated to the dentate gyrus (DG) to give rise to lifelong neurogenesis. In this study, we examined NPCs from the early postnatal hippocampus and DG of Fragile X mice (Fmr1 - KO). Immunocytochemistry on neurospheres showed increased Nestin expression and decreased Ki67 expression, which collectively indicated aberrant NPC biology. Intriguingly, flow cytometric analysis of the expression of the antigens CD15, CD24, CD133, GLAST, and PSA-NCAM showed a decreased proportion of neural stem cells (GLAST(+)CD15(+)CD133(+)) and an increased proportion of neuroblasts (PSA-NCAM(+)CD15(+)) in the DG of P7 Fmr1 - KO mice. This was mirrored by lower expression levels of Nestin and the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 in vivo in the P9 hippocampus, as well as a decreased proportion of cells in the G2/M phases of the P7 DG. Thus, the absence of FMRP leads to fewer actively cycling NPCs, coinciding with a decrease in neural stem cells and an increase in neuroblasts. Together, these results show the importance of FMRP in the developing hippocampal formation and suggest abnormalities in cell cycle regulation in Fragile X.",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
